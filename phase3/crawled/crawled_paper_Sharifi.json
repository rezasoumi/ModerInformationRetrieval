        "abstract": "It is shown that FGF4 and TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway inhibitors, designated R2i, not only provide the ground state pluripotency in production and maintenance of na\u00efve ES cells from blastocysts of different mouse strains, but also maintain ES cells with higher genomic integrity following long-term cultivation compared with the chemical inhibition of the FGF 4 and GSK3 pathways. Embryonic stem (ES) cells are considered to exist in a ground state if shielded from differentiation triggers. Here we show that FGF4 and TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway inhibitors, designated R2i, not only provide the ground state pluripotency in production and maintenance of na\u00efve ES cells from blastocysts of different mouse strains, but also maintain ES cells with higher genomic integrity following long-term cultivation compared with the chemical inhibition of the FGF4 and GSK3 pathways, known as 2i. Global transcriptome analysis of the ES cells highlights augmented BMP4 signaling pathway. The crucial role of the BMP4 pathway in maintaining the R2i ground state pluripotency is demonstrated by BMP4 receptor suppression, resulting in differentiation and cell death. In conclusion, by inhibiting TGF\u03b2 and FGF signaling pathways, we introduce a novel defined approach to efficiently establish the ground state pluripotency.",

        "abstract": "Data have indicated that hESCs primed with Rapa, and induced by a lower concentration of activin A, could lead to DE that had the capability to further differentiate into HLCs and PP cells, but not PE cells. Despite the enormous progress in studying definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), none of the reported protocols have produced a universal, cost-effective, and competent DE with the capability to further differentiate into endodermal derivatives. In this study, by using a 2-step differentiation strategy, we have treated hESCs for 1 day with \"priming\" small molecules (SM), [stauprimide, NSC-308848, rapamycin (Rapa), and/or CHIR] and for the next 3 days with \"inducing\" SM (LY294002, cymarin, IDE1, and/or IDE2) in conjunction with activin A. In the positive control group, we treated hESCs with Wnt3a (25\u2009ng/mL) for 1 day and activin A (100\u2009ng/mL; W/A100-A100) for the next 3 days. Gene expression analysis showed that treatment of hESCs with 100\u2009nM Rapa and 50\u2009ng/mL activin A (Rapa-A50) out of 25 combinations of factors gave rise to higher expressions of 2 DE-specific genes, SOX17 and FOXA2. Similar results were obtained after treating 2 other hESC lines with this regimen. To investigate the competency of Rapa-A50-induced DE for further differentiation into endodermal derivatives, these cells and W/A100-A100-induced DE cells (positive control) were further differentiated into pancreatic progenitors (PP), then into pancreatic endocrine (PE) cells using 5 previously described differentiation protocols. Gene analysis of differentiated cells showed that the established protocols were insufficient to enable universal differentiation into PE, whereas Rapa-A50-induced DE cells were more competent for PP differentiation in a protocol-dependent manner. Additionally, Rapa-A50-induced DE had the capability to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) as efficiently as W/A100-A100-induced DE. These data have indicated that hESCs primed with Rapa, and induced by a lower concentration of activin A, could lead to DE that had the capability to further differentiate into HLCs and PP cells, but not PE cells. Thus, current protocols for the differentiation of DE into PE still need additional study.",

        "abstract": "This article introduces the GTED problem and gives the first polynomial time algorithm for it, which is motivated by and provides the first mathematical formalism for sequence co-assembly and de novo variation detection in bioinformatics. Many problems in applied machine learning deal with graphs (also called networks), including social networks, security, web data mining, protein function prediction, and genome informatics. The kernel paradigm beautifully decouples the learning algorithm from the underlying geometric space, which renders graph kernels important for the aforementioned applications. In this article, we give a new graph kernel, which we call graph traversal edit distance (GTED). We introduce the GTED problem and give the first polynomial time algorithm for it. Informally, the GTED is the minimum edit distance between two strings formed by the edge labels of respective Eulerian traversals of the two graphs. Also, GTED is motivated by and provides the first mathematical formalism for sequence co-assembly and de novo variation detection in bioinformatics. We demonstrate that GTED admits a polynomial time algorithm using a linear program in the graph product space that is guaranteed to yield an integer solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to this problem. We also give a linear programming relaxation algorithm for a lower bound on GTED. We use GTED as a graph kernel and evaluate it by computing the accuracy of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier on a few data sets in the literature. Our results suggest that our kernel outperforms many of the common graph kernels in the tested data sets. As a second set of experiments, we successfully cluster viral genomes using GTED on their assembly graphs obtained from de novo assembly of next-generation sequencing reads.",

        "abstract": "The results show that DNA methylation discriminates promoters from enhancers through H3K 4me1-H3K4me3 seesaw mechanism, and suggest its possible function in the inheritance of chromatin marks after cell division, as well as suggesting aberrant formation of promoter-like regions and ectopic transcription of hypomethylated regions of DNA. BackgroundDNA methylation at promoters is largely correlated with inhibition of gene expression. However, the role of DNA methylation at enhancers is not fully understood, although a crosstalk with chromatin marks is expected. Actually, there exist contradictory reports about positive and negative correlations between DNA methylation and H3K4me1, a chromatin hallmark of enhancers.ResultsWe investigated the relationship between DNA methylation and active chromatin marks through genome-wide correlations, and found anti-correlation between H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 enrichment at low and intermediate DNA methylation loci. We hypothesized \u201cseesaw\u201d dynamics between H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 in the low and intermediate DNA methylation range, in which DNA methylation discriminates between enhancers and promoters, marked by H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, respectively. Low methylated regions are H3K4me3 enriched, while those with intermediate DNA methylation levels are progressively H3K4me1 enriched. Additionally, the enrichment of H3K27ac, distinguishing active from primed enhancers, follows a plateau in the lower range of the intermediate DNA methylation level, corresponding to active enhancers, and decreases linearly in the higher range of the intermediate DNA methylation. Thus, the decrease of the DNA methylation switches smoothly the state of the enhancers from a primed to an active state. We summarize these observations into a rule of thumb of one-out-of-three methylation marks: \u201cIn each genomic region only one out of these three methylation marks {DNA methylation, H3K4me1, H3K4me3} is high. If it is the DNA methylation, the region is inactive. If it is H3K4me1, the region is an enhancer, and if it is H3K4me3, the region is a promoter\u201d. To test our model, we used available genome-wide datasets of H3K4 methyltransferases knockouts. Our analysis suggests that CXXC proteins, as readers of non-methylated CpGs would regulate the \u201cseesaw\u201d mechanism that focuses H3K4me3 to unmethylated sites, while being repulsed from H3K4me1 decorated enhancers and CpG island shores.ConclusionsOur results show that DNA methylation discriminates promoters from enhancers through H3K4me1-H3K4me3 seesaw mechanism, and suggest its possible function in the inheritance of chromatin marks after cell division. Our analyses suggest aberrant formation of promoter-like regions and ectopic transcription of hypomethylated regions of DNA. Such mechanism process can have important implications in biological process in where it has been reported abnormal DNA methylation status such as cancer and aging.",

        "abstract": "Gene expression profile alterations in cumulus cells from both the IS and IR groups of PCOS patients seems to be involved in the composition and regulation of ECM during the ovulation process. Objective The extracellular matrix (ECM) of the cumulus oocyte complex (COC) is composed of several molecules that have different roles during follicle development. This study aims to explore gene expression profiles for ECM and cell adhesion molecules in the cumulus cells of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients based on their insulin sensitivity following controlled ovarian stimulation (COS). Materials and Methods In this prospective case-control study enrolled 23 women less than 36 years of age who participated in an intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) program. Patients were subdivided into 3 groups: control (n=8, fertile women with male infertility history), insulin resistant (IR) PCOS (n=7), and insulin sensitive (IS) PCOS (n=8). We compared 84 ECM component and adhesion molecule gene expressions by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction array (qPCR-array) among the groups. Results We noted that 21 of the 84 studied genes differentially expressed among the groups, from which 18 of these genes downregulated. Overall, comparison of PCOS cases with controls showed downregulation of extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1); catenin (cadherin-associated protein), alpha 1 (CTNNA1); integrin, alpha 5 (ITGA5); laminin, alpha 3 (LAMA3); laminin, beta 1 (LAMB1); fibronectin 1 (FN1); and integrin, alpha 7 (ITGA7). In the IS group, there was upregulation of ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 8 (ADAMTS8) and neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) compared with the controls (P<0.05). Conclusion Downregulation of ECM and cell adhesion molecules seem to be related to PCOS. Gene expression profile alterations in cumulus cells from both the IS and IR groups of PCOS patients seems to be involved in the composition and regulation of ECM during the ovulation process. This study highlights the association of ECM gene alteration as a viewpoint for additional understanding of the etiology of PCOS.",

Pluripotent cells appear to be in a transient state during early development. These cells have the capability to transition into embryonic stem cells (ESCs). It has been reported that mouse pluripotent cells cultivated in chemically defined media sustain the ground state of pluripotency. Because the epigenetic pattern of pluripotent cells reflects their environment, culture under different conditions causes epigenetic changes, which could lead to genomic instability. This study focused on the DNA methylation pattern of repetitive elements (REs) and their activation levels under two ground\u2010state conditions and assessed the genomic integrity of ESCs. We measured the methylation and expression level of REs in different media. The results indicated that although the ground\u2010state conditions show higher REs activity, they did not lead to DNA damage; therefore, the level of genomic instability is lower under the ground\u2010state compared with the conventional condition. Our results indicated that when choosing an optimum condition, different features of the condition must be considered to have epigenetically and genomically stable stem cells.",

Naive pluripotency exists in epiblast cells of mouse pre-implantation embryos. However, whether the naive pluripotency is transient or nonexistent in primate embryos remains unclear. Using RNA-seq in single blastomeres from 16-cell embryos through to hatched blastocysts of rhesus monkey, we constructed the lineage segregation roadmap in which the specification of trophectoderm, epiblast, and primitive endoderm is initiated simultaneously at the early blastocyst stage. Importantly, we uncovered the existence of distinct pluripotent states in monkey pre-implantation embryos. At the early- and middle-blastocyst stages, the epiblast cells have the transcriptome features of naive pluripotency, whereas they display a continuum of primed pluripotency characteristics at the late and hatched blastocyst stages. Moreover, we identified potential regulators that might play roles in the transition from naive to primed pluripotency. Thus, our study suggests the transient existence of naive pluripotency in primates and proposes an ideal time window for derivation of primate embryonic stem cells with naive pluripotency.",

        "abstract": "Objective Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are regulated by a gene regulatory circuitry composed of transcription factors, signaling pathways, metabolic mediators, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short ncRNAs which play crucial roles in ESCs. Here, we explored the impact of miR-302b-3p on ESC self-renewal in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Materials and Methods In this experimental study, ESCs were cultured in the presence of 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and induced to differentiate by LIF removal. miR-302b-3p overexpression was performed by transient transfection of mature miRNA mimics. Cell cycle profiling was done using propidium iodide (PI) staining followed by flow cytometry. miRNA expression was quantified using a miR-302b-3p-specific TaqMan assay. Data were analyzed using t test, and a P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results We observed that miR-302b-3p promoted the viability of both wild-type and LIF-withdrawn ESCs. It also increased ESC clonogenicity and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity. The defective cell cycling of LIF-deprived ESCs was completely rescued by miR-302b-3p delivery. Moreover, miR-302b-3p inhibited the increased cell death rate induced by LIF removal. Conclusion miR-302b-3p, as a pluripotency-associated miRNA, promotes diverse features of ESC self-renewal in the absence of extrinsic LIF signals.",

        "abstract": "Results showed that PGCs from different embryonic stages could be reprogrammed, maintained, and expanded efficiently under feeder- and serum-free chemically defined conditions by dual inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 and ERK signaling pathways, regardless of the animal's genetic background. Primordial germ cells (PGCs) have the ability to be reprogrammed into a pluripotent state and are defined as embryonic germ cells (EGCs) in vitro. EGC formation is more efficient, has a shorter culture period than somatic cell reprogramming, and does not require exogenous genetic manipulation. Therefore, EGCs are a good model to analyze mechanisms by which committed cells acquire a pluripotent state. In the present study we have attempted to elucidate a more defined and robust protocol that promotes EGC generation through the suppression of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways by SB431542 (SB) and PD0325901 (PD), respectively. Under this condition the efficiency of transformation of PGCs into EGCs was more than the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 and ERK signaling pathways. Pluripotency of the resultant-derived EGC lines were further confirmed by gene expression, immunofluorescent staining, directed differentiation ability, teratoma formation, and their contribution to chimeric mice and germ-line transmission. These results showed that PGCs from different embryonic stages (E8.5 and E12.5) could be reprogrammed, maintained, and expanded efficiently under feeder- and serum-free chemically defined conditions by dual inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 and ERK signaling pathways, regardless of the animal's genetic background.",

        "abstract": "Investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying ESC derivation in the R2i condition revealed that generation of ESCs in the ground-state of pluripotency could be achieved by inhibiting the MEK and TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways in the first 5 days of ESC derivations. Objective Dual inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (also known as MEK) and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) type I receptors by PD0325901 and SB431542, known as R2i has been introduced as a highly efficient approach to the generation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC). In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying ESC derivation in the R2i condition. Materials and Methods In this experimental study, zona-free whole E3.5 blastocysts were seeded on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder cells in both R2i and serum conventional media. The isolated inner cell mass (ICM), ESCs and the ICM-outgrowths were collected on days 3, 5 and 7 post-blastocyst culture for quantitative real time- polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis as well as to assess the DNA methylation status at the time points during the transition from ICM to ESC. Results qRT-PCR revealed a significantly higher expression of the pluripotency-related genes (Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, Rex1, Dppa3, Tcf3, Utf1, Nodal, Dax1, Sall4 and \u03b2-Catenin) and lower expression of early differentiation genes (Gata6, Lefty2 and Cdx2) in R2i condition compared to the serum condition. Moreover, the upstream region of Oct4 and Nanog showed a progressive increase in methylation levels in the upstream regions of the genes following in R2i or serum conditions, followed by a decrease of DNA methylation in ESCs obtained under R2i. However, the methylation level of ICM outgrowths in the serum condition was much higher than R2i, at levels that could have a repressive effect and therefore explain the absence of expression of these two genes in the serum condition. Conclusion Our investigation revealed that generation of ESCs in the ground-state of pluripotency could be achieved by inhibiting the MEK and TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways in the first 5 days of ESC derivation.",

The possibility to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) opens the way to generate virtually all cell types of our human body. In combination with modern gene editing techniques like CRISPR/CAS, a new set of powerful tools becomes available for life science. Scientific fields like genotype and cell type-specific pharmacology, disease modeling, stem cell biology, and developmental biology have been dramatically fostered and their faces have been changed. However, as golden as the age of iPSC-derived cells and their manipulation has started, the shine begins to tarnish. Researchers face more and more practical problems intrinsic to the system. These problems are related to the specific culturing conditions which are not yet sufficient to mimic the natural environment of native stem cells differentiating towards adult cells. However, researchers work hard to uncover these factors. Here, we review a common standard approach to generate iPSCs and transduce these to iPSC cardiomyocytes. Further, we review recent achievements and discuss their current limitations and future perspectives. We are on track, but the road is still under construction.",

        "abstract": "In this study, different small molecule combinations were applied during human ESC derivation, aimed to sustain the naive pluripotent state, by interfering with various key signaling pathways. Abstract In mice, inhibition of both the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (MEK/Erk) and the Wnt signaling inhibitor glycogen synthase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) enables the derivation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) from nonpermissive strains in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Whereas mESCs are in an uncommitted naive state, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) represent a more advanced state, denoted as primed pluripotency. This burdens hESCs with a series of characteristics, which, in contrast to naive ESCs, makes them not ideal for key applications such as cell-based clinical therapies and human disease modeling. In this study, different small molecule combinations were applied during human ESC derivation. Hereby, we aimed to sustain the naive pluripotent state, by interfering with various key signaling pathways. First, we tested several combinations on existing, 2i (PD0325901 and CHIR99021)-derived mESCs. All combination...",

Porcine pluripotent stem cells had been derived from different culture systems. PeNK6 is a porcine pluripotent stem cell line that we established from an E5.5 embryo in a defined culture system. Signaling pathways related with pluripotency had been assessed in this cell line, and TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway\u2013related genes were found upregulated significantly. In this study, we elucidated the role of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway in PeNK6 through adding small molecule inhibitors, SB431542 (KOSB) or A83-01 (KOA), into the original culture medium (KO) and analyzing the expression and activity of key factors involved in the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. In KOSB/KOA medium, the morphology of PeNK6 became compact and the nuclear-to-cytoplasm ratio was increased. The expression of the core transcription factor SOX2 was significantly upregulated compared with cell lines in the control KO medium, and the differentiation potential became balanced among three germ layers rather than bias to neuroectoderm/endoderm as the original PeNK6 did. The results indicated that inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 has positive effects on the porcine pluripotency. Based on these results, we established a pluripotent cell line (PeWKSB) from E5.5 blastocyst by employing TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors, and the cell line showed improved pluripotency.",

        "abstract": "While the Spd-A50 protocol led to DE production, it is shown that IDE1/2 could not fully replace activin A in DE induction of hESCs and lead to a better understanding of the different signaling networks that are involved in DE differentiation of h ESCs. Objective: In vitro production of a definitive endoderm (DE) is an important issue in stem cell-related differentiation studies and it can assist with the production of more efficient endoderm derivatives for therapeutic applications. Despite tremendous progress in DE differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), researchers have yet to discover universal, efficient and cost-effective protocols. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we have treated hESCs with 200 nM of Stauprimide (Spd) for one day followed by activin A (50 ng/ml; A50) for the next three days (Spd- A50). In the positive control group, hESCs were treated with Wnt3a (25 ng/ml) and activin A (100 ng/ml) for the first day followed by activin A for the next three days (100 ng/ml; W/A100-A100). Results: Gene expression analysis showed up regulation of DE-specific marker genes (SOX17, FOXA2 and CXCR4) comparable to that observed in the positive control group. Expression of the other lineage specific markers did not significantly change (p<0.05). We also obtained the same gene expression results using another hESC line. The use of higher concentrations of Spd (400 and 800 nM) in the Spd-A50 protocol caused an increase in the expression SOX17 as well as a dramatic increase in mortality rate of the hESCs. A lower concentration of activin A (25 ng/ml) was not able to up regulate the DE-specific marker genes. Then, A50 was replaced by inducers of definitive endoderm; IDE1/2 (IDE1 and IDE2), two previously reported small molecule (SM) inducers of DE, in our protocol (Spd-IDE1/2). This replacement resulted in the up regulation of visceral endoderm (VE) marker (SOX7) but not DE-specific markers. Therefore, while the Spd-A50 protocol led to DE production, we have shown that IDE1/2 could not fully replace activin A in DE induction of hESCs. Conclusion: These findings can assist with the design of more efficient chemically-defined protocols for DE induction of hESCs and lead to a better understanding of the different signaling networks that are involved in DE differentiation of hESCs.",

Definitive endoderm (DE) is the first stage of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) differentiation into hepatocyte\u2010like cells. Developing human liver cell models for pharmaceutical applications is highly demanding. Due to the vast number of existing protocols to generate DE cells from hPSCs, we aimed to compare the specificity and efficiency of selected published differentiation conditions. We differentiated two hPSC lines (induced PSC and embryonic stem cell) to DE cells on Matrigel matrix using growth factors (Activin A and Wnt\u20103a) and small molecules (sodium butyrate and IDE 1) in different combinations. By studying dynamic changes during 6 days in cell morphology and the expression of markers for pluripotency, DE, and other germ layer lineages, we found that Activin A is essential for DE differentiation, while Wnt\u20103a and sodium butyrate are dispensable. Although sodium butyrate exerted rapid DE differentiation kinetics, it caused massive cell death and could not generate sufficient cells for further differentiation and applications. We further discover that IDE 1 could not induce DE as reported previously. Hereby, we compared different conditions for DE induction and found an effective six day\u2010protocol to obtain DE cells for the further differentiation and applications.",

        "abstract": "The results showed that the initial size of hPSC aggregates significantly impacted on the efficacy of differentiation, and the medium sized-hPSpheres resulted in higher productivity and differentiation efficiency for scalable hepatocytes production, whereas small aggregates resulted in significant cell-loss after CHIR treatment and large aggregates had less efficacious endodermal differentiation. Dynamic suspension culture of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in stirred bioreactors provides a valuable scalable culture platform for integrated differentiation toward different lineages for potential research and therapeutic applications. However, current protocols for scalable and integrated differentiation of hPSCs limited due to high cost of growth factors and technical challenges. Here, hPSCs aggregates primed with 6 and 12\u2009\u03bcM of CHIR99021 (CHIR), a Wnt agonist, in combination with different concentrations of high cost Activin A (10, 25, 50, 100\u2009ng/mL). We sought to determine the appropriate treatment duration for efficient and cost-effective differentiation protocol for foregut definitive endoderm production in a dynamic suspension culture. Afterward, we evaluated the impact of the initial hPSC aggregate sizes (small: 86\u2009\u00b1\u200918\u2009\u03bcm; medium: 142\u2009\u00b1\u200932\u2009\u03bcm; large: 214\u2009\u00b1\u200934\u2009\u03bcm) as critical bioprocess parameter on differentiation efficacy at the beginning of induction. The results indicated that 1-day priming of hPSCs as 3D aggregates (hPSpheres) with 6\u2009\u03bcM CHIR followed by treatment with a low concentration of Activin (10\u2009ng/mL) for 2 days resulted in efficient differentiation to definitive endoderm. This finding confirmed by the presence of \u226570% SOX17/FOXA2-double positive cells that highly expressed the anterior endodermal marker HEX. These endodermal cells differentiated efficiently into mature functional hepatocytes [60% albumin (ALB)-positive cells]. The results showed that the initial size of hPSC aggregates significantly impacted on the efficacy of differentiation. The medium sized-hPSpheres resulted in higher productivity and differentiation efficiency for scalable hepatocytes production, whereas small aggregates resulted in significant cell-loss after CHIR treatment and large aggregates had less efficacious endodermal differentiation. Differentiated cells exhibited multiple characteristics of primary hepatocytes as evidenced by expressions of liver-specific markers, indocyanine green and low-density lipoprotein uptake, and glycogen storage. Thus, this platform could be employed for scalable production of hPSC-derived hepatocytes for clinical and drug discovery applications.",

        "abstract": "Results suggest that hydrocortisone can be a promoting factor in alveolar fate differentiation of IDE2- induced mESC-DE cells, which have potential for drug screening and cell-replacement therapies. Objective The ability to generate lung alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) enables the study of lung development, regenerative medicine, and modeling of lung diseases. The establishment of defined, scalable differentiation methods is a step toward this goal. This study intends to investigate the competency of small molecule induced mouse embryonic stem cell-derived definitive endoderm (mESC-DE) cells towards ATII cells. Materials and Methods In this experimental study, we designed a two-step differentiation protocol. mESC line Royan B20 (RB20) was induced to differentiate into DE (6 days) and then into ATII cells (9 days) by using an adherent culture method. To induce differentiation, we treated the mESCs for 6 days in serum-free differentiation (SFD) media and induced them with 200 nM small molecule inducer of definitive endoderm 2 (IDE2). For days 7-15 (9 days) of induction, we treated the resultant DE cells with new differentiation media comprised of 100 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) (group F), 0.5 \u03bcg/ml hydrocortisone (group H), and A549 conditioned medium (A549 CM) (group CM) in SFD media. Seven different combinations of factors were tested to assess the efficiencies of these factors to promote differentiation. The expressions of DE- and ATII-specific markers were investigated during each differentiation step. Results Although both F and H (alone and in combination) promoted differentiation through ATII-like cells, the highest percentage of surfactant protein C (SP-C) expressing cells (~37%) were produced in DE-like cells treated by F+H+CM. Ultrastructural analyses also confirmed the presence of lamellar bodies (LB) in the ATII-like cells. Conclusion These results suggest that hydrocortisone can be a promoting factor in alveolar fate differentiation of IDE2- induced mESC-DE cells. These cells have potential for drug screening and cell-replacement therapies.",

        "abstract": "Using modified DE differentiation protocols, satisfactory quantities of quality DE can be produced as primary material for further endoderm lineage differentiation, and massive cell death was avoided and the percentage of DE cells remained high. Definitive endoderm (DE) is a vital precursor for internal organs such as liver and pancreas. Efficient protocol to differentiate human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to DE is essential for regenerative medicine and for modeling diseases; yet, poor cell survival during DE differentiation remains unsolved. In this study, our use of B27 supplement in modified differentiation protocols has led to a substantial improvement. We used an SOX17-enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter hESC line to compare and modify established DE differentiation protocols. Both total live cell numbers and the percentages of eGFP-positive cells were used to assess differentiation efficiency. Among tested protocols, three modified protocols with serum-free B27 supplement were developed to generate a high number of DE cells. Massive cell death was avoided during DE differentiation and the percentage of DE cells remained high. When the resulting DE cells were further differentiated toward the pancreatic lineage, the expression of pancreatic-specific markers was significantly increased. Similar high DE differentiation efficiency was observed in H1\u2009hESCs and iPSCs through the modified protocols. In B27 components, bovine serum albumin was found to facilitate DE differentiation and cell survival. Using our modified DE differentiation protocols, satisfactory quantities of quality DE can be produced as primary material for further endoderm lineage differentiation.",

Hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) generated in vitro from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide an invaluable resource for basic research, regenerative medicine, drug screening, toxicology, and modeling of liver disease and development. This unit describes a small-molecule-driven protocol for in vitro differentiation of hPSCs into HLCs without the use of growth factors. hPSCs are coaxed through a developmentally relevant route via the primitive streak to definitive endoderm (DE) using the small molecule CHIR99021 (a Wnt agonist), replacing the conventional growth factors Wnt3A and activin A. The small-molecule-derived DE is then differentiated to hepatoblast-like cells in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide. The resulting hepatoblasts are then differentiated to HLCs with N-hexanoic-Tyr, Ile-6 aminohexanoic amide (Dihexa, a hepatocyte growth factor agonist) and dexamethasone. The protocol provides an efficient and reproducible procedure for differentiation of hPSCs into HLCs utilizing small molecules. \u00a9 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

        "abstract": "The current small-molecule-based hepatic generation protocol presents an efficient and cost-effective platform for the large-scale production of functional human hepatic cells for cell-based therapy and drug discovery using small molecules. Background Various methods have been developed to generate hepatic cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that rely on the combined use of multiple expensive growth factors, limiting industrial-scale production and widespread applications. Small molecules offer an attractive alternative to growth factors for producing hepatic cells since they are more economical and relatively stable. Methods We dissect small-molecule combinations and identify the ideal cocktails to achieve an optimally efficient and cost-effective strategy for hepatic cells differentiation, expansion, and maturation. Results We demonstrated that small-molecule cocktail CIP (including CHIR99021, IDE1, and PD0332991) efficiently induced definitive endoderm (DE) formation via increased endogenous TGF-\u03b2/Nodal signaling. Furthermore, we identified that combining Vitamin C, Dihexa, and Forskolin (VDF) could substitute growth factors to induce hepatic specification. The obtained hepatoblasts (HBs) could subsequently expand and mature into functional hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) by the established chemical formulas. Thus, we established a stepwise strategy with complete small molecules for efficiently producing scalable HBs and functionally matured HLCs. The small-molecule-derived HLCs displayed typical functional characteristics as mature hepatocytes in vitro and repopulating injured liver in vivo.

GTED was motivated by and provides the first mathematical formalism for sequence coassembly and de novo variation detection in bioinformatics. Many problems in applied machine learning deal with graphs (also called networks), including social networks, security, web data mining, protein function prediction, and genome informatics. The kernel paradigm beautifully decouples the learning algorithm from the underlying geometric space, which renders graph kernels important for the aforementioned applications. In this article, we introduce a tool, PyGTED to compute GTED. It implements the algorithm based on the polynomial time algorithm devised for it by the authors.

Data mining algorithms are facing the challenge to deal with an increasing number of complex objects. For graph data, a whole toolbox of data mining algorithms becomes available by defining a kernel function on instances of graphs. Graph kernels based on walks, subtrees and cycles in graphs have been proposed so far. As a general problem, these kernels are either computationally expensive or limited in their expressiveness. We try to overcome this problem by defining expressive graph kernels which are based on paths. As the computation of all paths and longest paths in a graph is NP-hard, we propose graph kernels based on shortest paths. These kernels are computable in polynomial time, retain expressivity and are still positive definite. In experiments on classification of graph models of proteins, our shortest-path kernels show significantly higher classification accuracy than walk-based kernels.",

        "abstract": "An update of the paternal epigenetic inheritance field is provided and links between paternally transmitted epigenetic influences and functional changes in the pre- and post-implantation embryo are proposed. Although more studies are demonstrating that a father\u2019s environment can influence child health and disease, the molecular mechanisms underlying non-genetic inheritance remain unclear. It was previously thought that sperm exclusively contributed its genome to the egg. More recently, association studies have shown that various environmental exposures including poor diet, toxicants, and stress, perturbed epigenetic marks in sperm at important reproductive and developmental loci that were associated with offspring phenotypes. The molecular and cellular routes that underlie how epigenetic marks are transmitted at fertilization, to resist epigenetic reprogramming in the embryo, and drive phenotypic changes are only now beginning to be unraveled. Here, we provide an overview of the state of the field of intergenerational paternal epigenetic inheritance in mammals and present new insights into the relationship between embryo development and the three pillars of epigenetic inheritance: chromatin, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNAs. We evaluate compelling evidence of sperm-mediated transmission and retention of paternal epigenetic marks in the embryo. Using landmark examples, we discuss how sperm-inherited regions may escape reprogramming to impact development via mechanisms that implicate transcription factors, chromatin organization, and transposable elements. Finally, we link paternally transmitted epigenetic marks to functional changes in the pre- and post-implantation embryo. Understanding how sperm-inherited epigenetic factors influence embryo development will permit a greater understanding related to the developmental origins of health and disease. Increasing evidence suggests parental environmental stressors can influence offspring health and disease outcomes. In this perspective, the authors provide an update of the paternal epigenetic inheritance field and propose links between paternally transmitted epigenetic influences and functional changes to the embryo.",

        "abstract": "Evaluating the effects of Metformin, Pioglitazone, Ripaglinide and Acarbose on histomorphological changes of polycystic ovaries showed that metformin and Piog Litazone have the same effects and can compensate for the damages due to PCOs. Background & Objective: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO) is one of the most common causes of infertility due to anovulatory in women. The use of insulin-sensitizing agents was one of the treatments for this syndrome. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of Metformin, Pioglitazone, Ripaglinide and Acarbose on histomorphological changes of polycystic ovaries. Materials & Methods : In this study, Polycystic ovaries were induced by injection of testosterone enanthate (TE) in immature female mice, for four weeks, then they had been divided into five groups; the control, Metformin, Pioglitazone, Repaglinide and Acarbose groups. Body weight, the ratio of ovary-to-animal weight, ovarian diameter, histomorphological changes of ovaries and characteristics of ovarian tissues were studied. Tukey test was used to calculate these parameters (P\u22640.05). Results : TE significantly increased the percentage of cystic Follicular and decreased follicular growth compared to treatment groups. The body weight, the ratio of ovary-to-animal weight and ovarian diameter, in all groups showed a significant decrease compared to the control group (p<0.05). In Metformin and Pioglitazone treated group, the number of degenerated oocytes, pyknotic-granlosa cells and vascularization were decreased and luteinization can be seen only in these groups. There is a significant reduction in mean growth of primordial, primary, pre-antral, cystic and atretic follicles in the treatment group. However, the mean number of pre-antral follicle showed a remarkable increase. The average number of antral follicles increased in metformin and pioglitazone groups (p<0.05). The results showed that Metformin and Pioglitazone groups cause a meaningful decrease in the ratio of ovary-to-animal weight (p<0.05). Conclusion : According to these results, Metformin and Pioglitazone have the same effects and can compensate for the damages due to PCOs. These drugs can develop follicular growth. Repaglinide can compensate for the damages in some cases, and, Acarbose has a negative effect on follicular growth.",

        "abstract": "These findings strongly advocate for high-resolution monitoring of human pluripotent stem cell lines, especially when intended to be used for clinical applications. Owing to their original properties, pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and their progenies are highly valuable not only for regenerative medicine, but also as tools to study development and pathologies or as cellular substrates to screen and test new drugs. However, ensuring their genomic integrity is one important prerequisite for both research and therapeutic applications. Until recently, several studies about the genomic stability of cultured hESCs had described chromosomal or else large genomic alterations detectable with conventional karyotypic methods. In the past year, several laboratories have reported many small genomic alterations, in the megabase-sized range, using more sensitive karyotyping methods, showing that hESCs are prone to acquire focal genomic abnormalities in culture. As these alterations were found to be nonrandom, these findings strongly advocate for high-resolution monitoring of human pluripotent stem cell lines, especially when intended to be used for clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "The IRF-1 expressed in the ICM of pigs\u2019 early blastocyst enhances the pluripotency of piPSCs, in part through promoting the JAK-STAT pathway. Background Despite years of research, porcine-induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSCs) with germline chimeric capacity have not been established. Furthermore, the key transcription factors (TFs) defining the na\u00efve state in piPSCs also remain elusive, even though TFs in the inner cell mass (ICM) are believed to be key molecular determinants of na\u00efve pluripotency. In this study, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) was screened to express higher in ICM than trophectoderm (TE). But the impact of IRF-1 on maintenance of pluripotency in piPSCs was not determined. Methods Transcriptome profiles of the early ICM were analyzed to determine highly interconnected TFs. Cells carrying these TFs\u2019 reporter were used to as donor cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer to detect expression patterns in blastocysts. Next, IRF1-Flag was overexpressed in DOX-hLIF-2i piPSCs and AP staining, qRT-PCR, and RNA-seq were conducted to examine the effect of IRF-1 on pluripotency. Then, the expression of IRF-1 in DOX-hLIF-2i piPSCs was labeled by GFP and qRT-PCR was conducted to determine the difference between GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells. Next, ChIP-Seq was conducted to identify genes target by IRF-1. Treatment with IL7 in wild-type piPSCs and STAT3 phosphorylation inhibitor in IRF-1 overexpressing piPSCs was conducted to confirm the roles of JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway in IRF-1\u2019s regulation of pluripotency. Moreover, during reprogramming, IRF-1 was overexpressed and knocked down to determine the change of reprogramming efficiency. Results IRF-1 was screened to be expressed higher in porcine ICM than TE of d6~7 SCNT blastocysts. First, overexpression of IRF-1 in the piPSCs was observed to promote the morphology, AP staining, and expression profiles of pluripotency genes as would be expected when cells approach the na\u00efve state. Genes, KEGG pathways, and GO terms related to the process of differentiation were also downregulated. Next, in the wild-type piPSCs, high-level fluorescence activated by the IRF-1 promoter was associated with higher expression of na\u00efve related genes in piPSCs. Analysis by ChIP-Seq indicated that genes related to the JAK-STAT pathway, and expression of IL7 and STAT3 were activated by IRF-1. The inhibitor of STAT3 phosphorylation was observed could revert the expression of primed genes in IRF-1 overexpressing cells, but the addition of IL7 in culture medium had no apparent change in the cell morphology, AP staining results, or expression of pluripotency related genes. In addition, knockdown of IRF-1 during reprogramming appeared to reduce reprogramming efficiency, whereas overexpression exerted the converse effect. Conclusion The IRF-1 expressed in the ICM of pigs\u2019 early blastocyst enhances the pluripotency of piPSCs, in part through promoting the JAK-STAT pathway.",

        "abstract": "Various routes of small ncRNA biogenesis, as well as different RNAi-mediated pathways in D. melanogaster are reviewed with a particular focus on signaling pathways. RNA interference (RNAi) is an important phenomenon that has diverse genetic regulatory functions at the pre- and posttranscriptional levels. The major trigger for the RNAi pathway is double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). dsRNA is processed to generate various types of major small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that include microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster). Functionally, these small ncRNAs play critical roles in virtually all biological systems and developmental pathways. Identification and processing of dsRNAs and activation of RNAi machinery are the three major academic interests that surround RNAi research. Mechanistically, some of the important biological functions of RNAi are achieved through: (i) supporting genomic stability via degradation of foreign viral genomes; (ii) suppressing the movement of transposable elements and, most importantly, (iii) post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by miRNAs that contribute to regulation of epigenetic modifications such as heterochromatin formation and genome imprinting. Here, we review various routes of small ncRNA biogenesis, as well as different RNAi-mediated pathways in D. melanogaster with a particular focus on signaling pathways. In addition, a critical discussion of the most relevant and latest findings that concern the significant contribution of small ncRNAs to the regulation of D. melanogaster physiology and pathophysiology is presented.",

        "title": "Does mouse embryo primordial germ cell activation start before implantation as suggested by single-cell transcriptomics dynamics?",
        "abstract": "Ch Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis has demonstrated that Dnmt3l is indeed a target of TCFAP2C and could potentially bind on DNMT3L, the stimulatory DNA methyltransferase co-factor that assists in the process of de novo DNA methylation. STUDY HYPOTHESIS\nDoes primordial germ cell (PGC) activation start before mouse embryo implantation, and does the possible regulation of the DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3-like (Dnmt3l) by transcription factor AP-2, gamma (TCFAP2C) have a role in this activation and in the primitive endoderm (PE)-epiblast (EPI) lineage specification?\n\n\nSTUDY FINDING\nA burst of expression of PGC markers, such as Dppa3/Stella, Ifitm2/Fragilis, Fkbp6 and Prdm4, is observed from embryonic day (E) 3.25, and some of them, together with the late germ cell markers Zp3, Mcf2 and Morc1, become restricted to the EPI subpopulation at E4.5, while the dynamics analysis of the PE-EPI transitions in the single-cell data suggests that TCFAP2C transitorily represses Dnmt3l in EPI cells at E3.5 and such repression is withdrawn with reactivation of Dnmt3l expression in PE and EPI cells at E4.5.\n\n\nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY\nIn the mouse preimplantation embryo, cells with the same phenotype take different fates based on the orchestration between topological clues (cell polarity, positional history and division orientation) and gene regulatory rules (at transcriptomics and epigenomics level), prompting the proposal of positional, stochastic and combined models explaining the specification mechanism. PGC specification starts at E6.0-6.5 post-implantation. In view of the important role of DNA methylation in developmental events, the cross-talk between some transcription factors and DNA methyltransferases is of particular relevance. TCFAP2C has a CpG DNA methylation motif that is not methylated in pluripotent cells and that could potentially bind on DNMT3L, the stimulatory DNA methyltransferase co-factor that assists in the process of de novo DNA methylation. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis has demonstrated that Dnmt3l is indeed a target of TCFAP2C.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN, SAMPLES/MATERIALS, METHODS\nWe aimed to assess the timing of early preimplantation events and to understand better the segregation of the inner cell mass (ICM) into PE and EPI. We designed a single-cell transcriptomics dynamics computational study to identify markers of the PE-EPI bifurcation in ICM cells through searching for statistically significant (using the Student's t-test method) differently expressed genes (DEGs) between PE and EPI cells from E3.5 to E4.5. The DEGs common for E3.5 and E4.5 were used as the markers defining the steady states. We collected microarray and next-generation sequencing transcriptomics data from public databases from bulk populations and single cells from mice at E3.25, E3.5 and E4.5. The results are based on three independent single-cell transcriptomics data sets, with a fold change of 3 and P-value <0.01 for the DEG selection.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE\nThe dynamics analysis revealed new transitory E3.5 and steady PE and EPI markers. Among the transitory E3.5 PE markers (Dnmt3l, Dusp4, Cpne8, Akap13, Dcaf12l1, Aaed1, B4galt6, BC100530, Rnpc3, Tfpi, Lgalsl, Ckap4 and Fbxl20), several (Dusp4, Akap13, Cpn8, Dcaf12l1 and Tfpi) are related to the extracellular regulated kinase pathway. We also identified new transitory E3.5 EPI markers (Sgk1, Mal, Ubxn2a, Atg16l2, Gm13102, Tcfap2c, Hexb, Slc1a1, Svip, Liph and Mier3), six new stable PE markers (Sdc4, Cpn1, Dkk1, Havcr1, F2r/Par1 and Slc7a6os) as well as three new stable EPI markers (Zp3, Mcf2 and Hexb), which are known to be late stage germ cell markers. We found that mouse PGC marker activation starts at least at E3.25 preimplantation. The transcriptomics dynamics analyses support the regulation of Dnmt3l expression by TCFAP2C.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION\nSince the regulation of Dnmt3l by TCFAP2C is based on computational prediction of DNA methylation motifs, Chip-Seq and transcriptomics data, functional studies are required to validate this result.\n\n\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS\nWe identified a collection of previously undescribed E3.5-specific PE and EPI markers, and new steady PE and EPI markers. Identification of these genes, many of which encode cell membrane proteins, will facilitate the isolation and characterization of early PE and EPI populations. Since it is so well established in the literature that mouse PGC specification is a post-implantation event, it was surprising for us to see activation of PGC markers as early as E3.25 preimplantation, and identify the newly found steady EPI markers as late germ cell markers. The discovery of such early activation of PGC markers has important implications in the derivation of germ cells from pluripotent cells (embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells), since the initial stages of such derivation resemble early development. The early activation of PGC markers points out the difficulty of separating PGC cells from pluripotent populations. Collectively, our results suggest that the combining of the precision of single-cell omics data with dynamic analysis of time-series data can establish the timing of some developmental stages as earlier than previously thought.\n\n\nLARGE-SCALE DATA\nNot applicable.\n\n\nSTUDY FUNDING AND COMPETING INTERESTS\nThis work was supported by grants DFG15/14 and DFG15/020 from Diputaci\u00f3n Foral de Gipuzkoa (Spain), and grant II14/00016 from I + D + I National Plan 2013-2016 (Spain) and FEDER funds.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in monolayer-based methods that have improved the efficiency and scalability of cardiomyocyte differentiation are summarized. Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are a promising cell source for cardiac tissue engineering and cell-based therapies for heart repair because they can be expanded in vitro and differentiated into most cardiovascular cell types, including cardiomyocytes. During embryonic heart development, this differentiation occurs under the influence of internal and external stimuli that guide cells to go down the cardiac lineage. In order to differentiate PSCs in vitro, these or similar stimuli need to be provided in a controlled manner. However, because it is not possible to completely recapitulate the embryonic environment, the factors essential for cardiac differentiation of PSCs in vitro need to be experimentally determined and validated. Since PSCs were first developed, significant progress has been made in optimizing techniques for their differentiation toward cardiomyocytes. In this review, we will summarize recent advances in these techniques, with particular focus on monolayer-based methods that have improved the efficiency and scalability of cardiomyocyte differentiation.",

        "abstract": "Overall, the 3-D culture system supported the expansion of a homogenous population of ESCs and should be helpful in advancing their use for cell therapy and regenerative medicine. The maintenance and expansion of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in two-dimensional (2-D) culture is technically challenging, requiring routine manipulation and passaging. We developed three-dimensional (3-D) scaffolds to mimic the in vivo microenvironment for stem cell proliferation. The scaffolds were made of two 8-arm polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers functionalized with thiol (PEG-8-SH) and acrylate (PEG-8-Acr) end groups, which self-assembled via a Michael addition reaction. When primed ESCs (H9 cells) were mixed with PEG polymers, they were encapsulated and grew for an extended period, while maintaining their viability, self-renewal, and differentiation potential both in vitro and in vivo. Three-dimensional (3-D) self-assembling scaffold-grown cells displayed an upregulation of core pluripotency genes, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2. In addition, the expression of primed markers decreased, while the expression of na\u00efve markers substantially increased. Interestingly, the expression of mechanosensitive genes, YAP and TAZ, was also upregulated. YAP inhibition by Verteporfin abrogated the increased expression of YAP/TAZ as well as core and na\u00efve pluripotent markers. Evidently, the 3-D culture conditions induced the upregulation of makers associated with a na\u00efve state of pluripotency in the primed cells. Overall, our 3-D culture system supported the expansion of a homogenous population of ESCs and should be helpful in advancing their use for cell therapy and regenerative medicine.",

        "abstract": "The history of stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell technology in the context of hepatic differentiation is summarized and the potential applications the technology may offer for human liver disease modeling and treatment are discussed. Liver disease is a major global health concern. Liver cirrhosis is one of the leading causes of death in the world and currently the only therapeutic option for end\u2010stage liver disease (e.g., acute liver failure, cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, cholestatic diseases, metabolic diseases, and malignant neoplasms) is orthotropic liver transplantation. Transplantation of hepatocytes has been proposed and used as an alternative to whole organ transplant to stabilize and prolong the lives of patients in some clinical cases. Although these experimental therapies have demonstrated promising and beneficial results, their routine use remains a challenge due to the shortage of donor livers available for cell isolation, variable quality of those tissues, the potential need for lifelong immunosuppression in the transplant recipient, and high costs. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies and more reliable clinical treatments are urgently needed. Recent and continuous technological advances in the development of stem cells suggest they may be beneficial in this respect. In this review, we summarize the history of stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology in the context of hepatic differentiation and discuss the potential applications the technology may offer for human liver disease modeling and treatment. This includes developing safer drugs and cell\u2010based therapies to improve the outcomes of patients with currently incurable health illnesses. We also review promising advances in other disease areas to highlight how the stem cell technology could be applied to liver diseases in the future. \u00a9 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Tissues and cells derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSC) are likely to become widely used in disease modeling, drug screening, and regenerative medicine. For these applications, the in vitro PSC differentiation process must be elaborately investigated and controlled to reliably obtain the desired end products. However, because traditional experimental methods, such as one factor at a time or brute\u2010force approaches, are impractical for detailed screening of complex PSC cultivation conditions, more strategic and effective screening based on statistical design of experiments (DOE) ought to be indispensable. Among various DOE approaches, we regard robust parameter design (RPD) as particularly suited for differentiation protocol optimization due to its suitability for multifactorial screening. We confirmed the adaptability of RPD for investigating human induced PSC lineage specification toward anterior\u2010posterior gut tube endodermal cells and clarified both the contribution of each cell signaling pathway and the effect of cell signaling condition alteration on marker RNA expression levels, while increasing the efficiency of the screening in 243\u2010fold (18 vs 4374) compared with that of a brute\u2010force approach. Specific induction of anterior foregut, hepatic, pancreatic, or mid\u2010hindgut cells was achieved using seven iPSC strains with the optimal culture protocols established on the basis of RPD analysis. RPD has the potential to enable efficient construction and optimization of PSC differentiation protocols, and its use is recommended from fundamental research to mass production of PSC\u2010derived products.",

        "abstract": "It is demonstrated that DS played an important role in controlling the size of hPSC aggregates in 3D suspension culture by inhibiting the expression of ICAM1 coupled with the down-regulation of E-cad through the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Background Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have great potential in applications for regenerative medicine and drug development. However, 3D suspension culture systems for clinical-grade hPSC large-scale production have been a major challenge. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the addition of dextran sulfate (DS) could prevent excessive adhesion of hPSCs from forming larger aggregates in 3D suspension culture. However, the signaling and molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. Methods By using a cell aggregate culture assay and separating big and small aggregates in suspension culture systems, the potential mechanism and downstream target genes of DS were investigated by mRNA sequence analysis, qRT-PCR validation, colony formation assay, and interference assay. Results Since cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) play important roles in hPSC adhesion and aggregation, we assumed that DS might prevent excess adhesion through affecting the expression of CAMs in hPSCs. As expected, after DS treatment, we found that the expression of CAMs was significantly down-regulated, especially E-cadherin (E-cad) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), two highly expressed CAMs in hPSCs. The role of E-cad in the adhesion of hPSCs has been widely investigated, but the function of ICAM1 in hPSCs is hardly understood. In the present study, we demonstrated that ICAM1 exhibited the capacity to promote the adhesion in hPSCs, and this adhesion was suppressed by the treatment with DS. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of RNA-seq revealed that DS treatment up-regulated genes related to Wnt signaling resulting in the activation of Wnt signaling in which SLUG, TWIST, and MMP3/7 were highly expressed, and further inhibited the expression of E-cad. Conclusion Our results demonstrated that DS played an important role in controlling the size of hPSC aggregates in 3D suspension culture by inhibiting the expression of ICAM1 coupled with the down-regulation of E-cad through the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. These results represent a significant step toward developing the expansion of hPSCs under 3D suspension condition in large-scale cultures.",

        "abstract": "These findings could form the basis for the enrichment of ES cell-derived cultures with type II pneumocytes, and provide an in vitro system for investigating mechanisms of lung repair and regeneration. Embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency is being investigated increasingly to obtain specific cell lineages for tissue engineering. However, the possibility that ES cells can give rise to lung tissue has not been tested. We hypothesized that lung epithelial cells (type II pneumocytes) can be derived in vitro from murine ES cells. After withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and formation of embryoid bodies in maintenance medium for 10, 20, and 30 days, differentiating ES cells were kept in the same medium or transferred to serum-free small airway growth medium (SAGM) for a further 3 or 14 days of culture. The presence of type II pneumocytes in the resulting mixed cultures was demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of surfactant protein C (SPC) mRNA, immunostaining of SPC, and electron microscopy of osmiophilic lamellar bodies only at 30 days sampling time. SAGM appeared to be more favorable for type II cell formation than ES medium. No SPC transcripts were found in differentiating cells grown under the same conditions without formation of embryoid bodies. These findings could form the basis for the enrichment of ES cell-derived cultures with type II pneumocytes, and provide an in vitro system for investigating mechanisms of lung repair and regeneration.",

        "abstract": "This study demonstrates how the properties of a chosen biomaterial influence the differentiation process and the importance of spheroid size control for successful human iPSC differentiation and provides critical parametric information for the generation of human DE-derived, tissue-specific organoids in future studies. The generation of human stem cell-derived spheroids and organoids represents a major step in solving numerous medical, pharmacological, and biological challenges. Due to the advantages of three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems and the diverse applications of human pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived definitive endoderm (DE), we studied the influence of spheroid size and 3D cell culture systems on spheroid morphology and the effectiveness of DE differentiation as assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR), flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and computational modeling. Among the tested hydrogel-based 3D systems, we found that basement membrane extract (BME) hydrogel could not retain spheroid morphology due to dominant cell\u2013matrix interactions. On the other hand, we found that nanofibrillar cellulose (NFC) hydrogel could maintain spheroid morphology but impeded growth factor diffusion, thereby negatively affecting cell differentiation. In contrast, suspension culture provided sufficient mass transfer and was demonstrated by protein expression assays, morphological analyses, and mathematical modeling to be superior to the hydrogel-based systems. In addition, we found that spheroid size was reversely correlated with the effectiveness of DE formation. However, spheroids of insufficient sizes failed to retain 3D morphology during differentiation in all the studied culture conditions. We hereby demonstrate how the properties of a chosen biomaterial influence the differentiation process and the importance of spheroid size control for successful human iPSC differentiation. Our study provides critical parametric information for the generation of human DE-derived, tissue-specific organoids in future studies.",

Pattern recognition algorithms are facing the challenge to deal with an increasing number of complex objects. For graph data, a whole toolbox of pattern recognition algorithms becomes available by defining a kernel function on instances of graphs. Graph similarity is the central problem for all learning tasks such as clustering and classification on graphs. Graph kernels based on walks, subtrees and cycles in graphs have been proposed so far. As a general problem, these kernels are either computationally expensive or limited in their expressiveness. We try to overcome this problem by defining expressive graph kernels which are based on spanning-tree. Minimum spanning-tree, maximum spanning-tree kernels and mix spanning-tree kernel are computable in polynomial time, retain expressivity and are still positive definite. In experiments on classification of graph models of face images, our spanning-tree kernels show significantly higher classification accuracy than walk-based kernels.",

Sperm epigenome undergoes age-dependent changes increasing risks of adverse conditions in offspring conceived by fathers of advanced age. The mechanism(s) linking paternal age with epigenetic changes in sperm remains unknown. The sperm epigenome is shaped in a compartment protected by the blood-testes barrier (BTB) known to deteriorate with age. Permeability of the BTB is regulated by the balance of two mTOR complexes in Sertoli cells. We hypothesized that this balance is also responsible for age-dependent changes in the sperm epigenome. Experiments with transgenic mice demonstrate that the shift of the balance in favor of mTOR complex two rejuvenates sperm DNA-methylome while the shift in favor of mTOR complex one accelerates aging of the sperm DNA-methylome and results in a reproductive phenotype concordant with older age.

Fifty two women with PCOS aged 20-45 years were randomly allocated to one of the two treatment groups. All patients underwent clinical and biochemical evaluation and analyses involving these measures which consisted of repeated measures MANOVA using the pre- and post-intervention fasting blood sugar (FBS), lipid profiles, body mass index (BMI), serum insulin in two groups.\n\n\nRESULTS\nweight and BMI were significantly decreased in metformin group but not in case of pioglitazone. FBS, serum triglycerides, total cholesterol were all reduced significantly by both metfomin and pioglitazone. Insulin resistance measured by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) method was significantly decreased in both treatment groups (P<0.05). There were no significant differences between treatments in most of variables except BMI.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nthese results suggest pioglitazone is as effective as metformin in improving insulin sensitivity and some cardiovascular risk biomarkers but it has no significant effect on reducing BMI and body weight.",

        "abstract": "It is shown that karyotypes and copy number variations are not restricted to long-term culture, but can occur very rapidly, within five passages after switching hESCs to enzymatic dissociation, and subchromosomal abnormalities preceded or accompanied karyotype abnormalities and were associated with increased occurrence of DNA double-strand breaks. Simplified culture conditions are essential for large-scale drug screening and medical applications of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). However, hPSCs [ie, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are prone to genomic instability, a phenomenon that is highly influenced by the culture conditions. Enzymatic dissociation, a cornerstone of large-scale hPSC culture systems, has been reported to be deleterious, but the extent and the timeline of the genomic alterations induced by this passaging technique are still unclear. We prospectively monitored three hESC lines that were initially derived and cultured on human feeders and passaged mechanically before switching to enzymatic single-cell passaging. We show that karyotype abnormalities and copy number variations are not restricted to long-term culture, but can occur very rapidly, within five passages after switching hESCs to enzymatic dissociation. Subchromosomal abnormalities preceded or accompanied karyotype abnormalities and were associated with increased occurrence of DNA double-strand breaks. Our results indicate that enzymatic single-cell passaging can be highly deleterious to the hPSC genome, even when used only for a limited period of time. Moreover, hPSC culture techniques should be reappraised by complementing the routine karyotype analysis with more sensitive techniques, such as microarrays, to detect subchromosomal abnormalities.",

        "abstract": "The species affinity of the exogenousTFs is a key element, and the own species origin of TFs is optimal for iPSCs generation and application. The incomplete silencing of exogenous transcription factors (TFs) and the lack of endogenous counterpart activation hampers the application of porcine induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSCs). We used porcine, bovine and murine TFs to reprogram porcine fetal fibroblasts. Porcine TFs-derived piPSCs (ppiPSCs) showed the highest levels of endogenous pluripotency markers activation, were able to differentiate into three germ layers and primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) and integrated into neural ectoderm of E7.5 mouse embryos in vitro. The bovine TFs derived piPSCs (bpiPSCs) expressed endogenous pluripotency markers higher than murine TFs derived piPSCs (mpiPSCs), but both had limited differentiation ability in vitro and depended on continuous expression of exogenous TFs for the maintenance. RNA sequencing confirmed ppiPSCs had distinct global transcriptional profiling, upregulated Hippo, PI3K-Akt, MAPK and relevant pluripotency signaling pathways as porcine blastocyst inner cell mass and expressed PGC early related genes. In addition, a positive and a negative correlation between exogenous and endogenous TFs\u2019 expression level were observed in ppiPSCs and bpiPSCs lines, respectively. The TFs\u2019 protein structures in pig were more similar to cattle than to mouse. In conclusion, the species affinity of the exogenous TFs is a key element, and the own species origin of TFs is optimal for iPSCs generation and application.",

        "abstract": "A complex landscape of miRNA expression is revealed and it is revealed that whilst a null mutation in dis3L2 has a minimal effect on the mi RNA expression profile, loss of Pacman has a profound effect with a third of all detected miRNAs demonstrating Pacman-sensitivity. The control of gene expression is a fundamental process essential for correct development and to maintain homeostasis. Many post-transcriptional mechanisms exist to maintain the correct levels of each RNA transcript within the cell. Controlled and targeted cytoplasmic RNA degradation is one such mechanism with the 5\u2019-3\u2019 exoribonuclease Pacman (XRN1) and the 3\u2019-5\u2019 exoribonuclease Dis3L2 playing crucial roles. Loss of function mutations in either Pacman or Dis3L2 have been demonstrated to result in distinct phenotypes, and both have been implicated in human disease. One mechanism by which gene expression is controlled is through the function of miRNAs which have been shown to be crucial for the control of almost all cellular processes. Although the biogenesis and mechanisms of action of miRNAs have been comprehensively studied, the mechanisms regulating their own turnover are not well understood. Here we characterise the miRNA landscape in a natural developing tissue, the Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal disc, and assess the importance of Pacman and Dis3L2 on the abundance of miRNAs. We reveal a complex landscape of miRNA expression and show that whilst a null mutation in dis3L2 has a minimal effect on the miRNA expression profile, loss of Pacman has a profound effect with a third of all detected miRNAs demonstrating Pacman-sensitivity. We also reveal a role of Pacman in regulating the highly conserved let-7 cluster (containing miR-100, let-7 and miR-125) and present a genetic model outlining a positive feedback loop regulated by Pacman which begins to explain the apoptotic phenotype observed in Pacman mutants.",

        "abstract": "A new clustering algorithm, hierarchical optimal k-means (HOkM), is developed and identified from single cell (sc) transcriptomics microarray data two groups of ICM cells during the 32 to 64 mouse embryo transition: from embryos with less than 34 cells, and more than 33 cells, corresponding to two developmental sub-stages. The time of onset of the second cell fate decision in the mouse preimplantation embryo is still unknown. Ohnishi et al. (2014) looked for cell heterogeneity in the ICM at E3.25 that could indicate the time preceding the apparent segregation of PE and EPI at E3.5, but were not able to detect an early splitting transcriptomics event using state-of-the-art clustering techniques. We developed a new clustering algorithm, hierarchical optimal k-means (HOkM), and identified from single cell (sc) transcriptomics microarray data two groups of ICM cells during the 32 to 64 mouse embryo transition: from embryos with less than 34 cells, and more than 33 cells, corresponding to two developmental sub-stages. The genes defining these sub-stages indicate that the development of the embryo to 34 cells triggers a dramatic event as a result of which Bsg is high expressed, the canonical Wnt pathway is activated, Oct4 is stabilized to high expression and the chromatin remodeling program is initialized to establish a very early narve pluripotent state from the preceding totipotency. We characterized our HOkM partition comparing with independent scRNA-seq datasets. It was staggering to discover that from the 3.4360\u00d71010 possible bi-partitions of the E3.25 data of Ohnishi et al. (2014), our HOkM discovered one partition that shares the biological features of the early and late 32 ICM cells of Posfai et al. (2017). We propose that the stabilization of Oct4 expression is a non-cell autonomous process that requires a minimal number of four inner cell contacts acquired during the transition from a homogeneous outer-cell environment to a heterogeneous inner/outer cell environment formed by the niche of a kernel of at least six inner cells covered by trophectoderm.",

        "abstract": "There is a strong need for better understanding the biology, manipulation and safety of stem cells in tissue regeneration and repair before starting the therapeutic applications of stem cell therapy. Introduction. Stem cells have the extraordinary potential to develop into many diverse cell types in the body during early life and growth. Significant progress has been made in understanding the biochemical and metabolic mechanisms and feedback associated with different stem cells response. Some of the challenges concerning transplanted embryonic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells are immune-mediated rejection, senescence-induced genetic instability or loss of function, and limited cell survival. Aim. The aim of this review, is to recapitulate the recent status and information about the use of embryonic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells for research into how cells and tissues of the body grow and develop, and potentially useful for curing disease. Results. Stem cell therapy efforts are currently underway for virtually every type of tissue and organ within the human body. Because the current status of stem cell incorporates the fields of cell transplantation, materials science, and engineering, personnel who have mastered the techniques of cell harvest, culture, expansion, transplantation, and polymer design are essential for the successful application of this technology. Various stem cell therapies are at different stages of development, with some already being used clinically, a few in preclinical trials, and some in the discovery stage. Recommendations. Recent progresses suggest that stem cell therapy may have expanded clinical applicability in the future because they represent a viable therapeutic option for those who require tissue and cells replacement in diverse degenerative disease. More recently, major advances in the areas of stem cell biology, tissue engineering, and nuclear transfer techniques have made it possible to combine these technologies to create the comprehensive scientific field of regenerative medicine. \u201cBut there is a strong need for better understanding the biology, manipulation and safety of stem cells in tissue regeneration and repair before starting the therapeutic applications.\u201d Review PII: S225199391900009-9 Rec. 16 August 2018 Rev. 15 February 2019 Pub. 25 March 2019",

        "abstract": "This review examines how differences in culture media impact on the characteristics of pluripotency via modulation of GRN during the course of ICM outgrowth into ESCs and discusses generation of ESCs from human embryos and domesticated animals. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are immortal stem cells that own multi-lineage differentiation potential. ESCs are commonly derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of pre-implantation embryos. Due to their tremendous developmental capacity and unlimited self-renewal, ESCs have diverse biomedical applications. Different culture media have been developed to procure and maintain ESCs in a state of na\u00efve pluripotency, and to preserve a stable genome and epigenome during serial passaging. Chromatin modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications along with microRNA activity and different signaling pathways dynamically contribute to the regulation of the ESC gene regulatory network (GRN). Such modifications undergo remarkable changes in different ESC media and determine the quality and developmental potential of ESCs. In this review, we discuss the current approaches for derivation and maintenance of ESCs, and examine how differences in culture media impact on the characteristics of pluripotency via modulation of GRN during the course of ICM outgrowth into ESCs. We also summarize the current hypotheses concerning the origin of ESCs and provide a perspective about the relationship of these cells to their in vivo counterparts (early embryonic cells around the time of implantation). Finally, we discuss generation of ESCs from human embryos and domesticated animals, and offer suggestions to further advance this fascinating field.",

        "abstract": "More than 35 tools developed specifically for plant sRNA datasets are reviewed and some of their basic algorithms for performing tasks related to predicting, identifying, categorizing, and quantifying individual sRNAs in plant samples are explored, as well as visualizing the results of these analyzes. Plant small RNAs (sRNAs) are a heterogeneous group of noncoding RNAs with a length of 20\u201324 nucleotides that are widely studied due to their importance as major regulators in various biological processes. sRNAs are divided into two main classes\u2014microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)\u2014which differ in their biogenesis and functional pathways. Their identification and enrichment with new structural variants would not be possible without the use of various high-throughput sequencing (NGS) techniques, allowing for the detection of the total population of sRNAs in plants. Classifying sRNAs and predicting their functional role based on such high-performance datasets is a nontrivial bioinformatics task, as plants can generate millions of sRNAs from a variety of biosynthetic pathways. Over the years, many computing tools have been developed to meet this challenge. Here, we review more than 35 tools developed specifically for plant sRNAs over the past few years and explore some of their basic algorithms for performing tasks related to predicting, identifying, categorizing, and quantifying individual sRNAs in plant samples, as well as visualizing the results of these analyzes. We believe that this review will be practical for biologists who want to analyze their plant sRNA datasets but are overwhelmed by the number of tools available, thus answering the basic question of how to choose the right one for a particular study.",

Cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are emerging as an invaluable alternative to primarily sourced cardiomyocytes. The potentially unlimited number of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) that may be obtained in vitro facilitates high-throughput applications like cell transplantation for myocardial repair, cardiotoxicity testing during drug development, and patient-specific disease modeling. Despite promising progress in these areas, a major disadvantage that limits the use of hPSC-CMs is their immaturity. Improvements to the maturity of hPSC-CMs are necessary to capture physiologically relevant responses. Herein, we review and discuss the different maturation strategies undertaken by others to improve the morphology, contractility, electrophysiology, and metabolism of these derived cardiomyocytes.",

        "abstract": "3-D scaffolds are described that support growth and maintenance of the na\u00efve state characteristics of human ESC line, Elf1 and provide insight into the possible mechanisms of prolonged self-renewal as well as upregulation of pluripotent genes stimulated by the transduction of mechanical signals from the 3-D microenvironment. Derivation of primed and na\u00efve human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have prompted an increased interest in devising culture conditions for maintaining their pluripotency and differential potential. Na\u00efve ESCs are characterized by improved viability, proliferation, and differentiation capacity in comparison to primed ESCs. However, traditional two-dimensional (2-D) cell culture techniques fail to mimic the three-dimensional (3-D) in vivo microenvironment, which results in altered morphological and molecular characteristics of ESCs. Here, we describe the use of 3-D self-assembling scaffolds that support growth and maintenance of the na\u00efve state characteristics of human ESC line, Elf1. Scaffolds were formed via a Michael addition reaction upon combination of two 8-arm polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers functionalized with thiol (PEG-8-SH) and acrylate (PEG-8-Acr) end groups. 3-D scaffolds not only maintained the na\u00efve state, but also supported long-term growth for up to 3 weeks without requiring routine passaging and manipulation. 3-D grown cells exhibited upregulation of core (OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2) and na\u00efve (KLF17, KLF4, TFCP2L1, DPPA3, and DNMT3L) genes. These genes returned to normal levels when 3-D grown cells were propagated under 2-D culture conditions. Examination of RNA-sequencing demonstrated significant changes in gene expression profiles between 2-D and 3-D grown Elf1 cells. Gene Ontology analysis revealed upregulation of biological processes involved in the regulation of transcription and translation, as well as \u03b2-catenin-TCF complex assembly, extracellular matrix organization, and chromatin remodeling in 3-D grown Elf1 cells. 3-D culture conditions also induced upregulation of genes associated with several signaling pathways including Wnt signaling and focal adhesion. However, p53 signaling pathway associated genes were downregulated under these culture conditions. Our findings provide insight into the possible mechanisms of prolonged self-renewal as well as upregulation of pluripotent genes stimulated by the transduction of mechanical signals from the 3-D microenvironment.",

        "abstract": "Current challenges for generating differentiated cells compatible with human application as well as in-depth safety evaluation are discussed and the potential benefits that will produce a great impact in the field of hepatology are pointed out. The only curative treatment for severe end-stage liver disease (ESLD) is liver transplantation (LT) but it is limited by the shortage of organ donors. The increase of the incidence of liver disease has led to develop new therapeutic approaches such as liver cell transplantation. Current challenges that limit a wider application of this therapy include a limited cell source and the poor engraftment in the host liver of cryopreserved hepatocytes after thawing. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that can be differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) are being widely explored as an alternative to human hepatocytes because of their unlimited proliferation capacity and their potential ability to avoid the immune system. Their large-scale production could provide a new tool to produce enough HLCs for treating patients with metabolic diseases, acute liver failure (ALF), those with ESLD or patients not considered for organ transplantation. In this review we discuss current challenges for generating differentiated cells compatible with human application as well as in-depth safety evaluation. This analysis highlights the uncertainties and deficiencies that should be addressed before their clinical use but also points out the potential benefits that will produce a great impact in the field of hepatology.",

        "abstract": "This review summarizes DOE-based cell culture optimizations of PSCs, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), hematopoieticstem cells (HSCs), and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which guide effective research and development of P SC-derived materials for academic and industrial applications. For practical use of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) for disease modelling, drug screening, and regenerative medicine, the cell differentiation process needs to be properly refined to generate end products with consistent and high quality. To construct and optimize a robust cell-induction process, a myriad of cell culture conditions should be considered. In contrast to inefficient brute-force screening, statistical design of experiments (DOE) approaches, such as factorial design, orthogonal array design, response surface methodology (RSM), definitive screening design (DSD), and mixture design, enable efficient and strategic screening of conditions in smaller experimental runs through multifactorial screening and/or quantitative modeling. Although DOE has become routinely utilized in the bioengineering and pharmaceutical fields, the imminent need of more detailed cell-lineage specification, complex organoid construction, and a stable supply of qualified cell-derived material requires expedition of DOE utilization in stem cell bioprocessing. This review summarizes DOE-based cell culture optimizations of PSCs, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which guide effective research and development of PSC-derived materials for academic and industrial applications.",

        "abstract": "Investigation revealed that the activation of Hippo and AMPK signaling pathways made contributions to the regulation of function and cellular polarity in phEHs, further verifying that the liver function of hEHs was closely related with their polarization state. Hepatocytes exhibit a multi-polarized state under the in vivo physiological environment, however, human embryonic stem cell-derived hepatocytes (hEHs) rarely exhibit polarity features in a two-dimensional (2D) condition. Thus, we hypothesized whether the polarized differentiation might enhance the maturity and liver function of hEHs. In this study, we obtained the polarized hEHs (phEHs) by using 2D differentiation in conjunct with employing transwell-based polarized culture. Our results showed that phEHs directionally secreted albumin, urea and bile acids, and afterward, the apical membrane and blood\u2013bile barrier (BBIB) were identified to form in phEHs. Moreover, phEHs exhibited a higher maturity and capacitity of cellular secretory and drug metabolism than those of non-phEHs. Through transcriptome analysis, it was found that the polarized differentiation induced obvious changes in gene expression profiles of cellular adhesion and membrane transport in hEHs. Our further investigation revealed that the activation of Hippo and AMPK signaling pathways made contributions to the regulation of function and cellular polarity in phEHs, further verifying that the liver function of hEHs was closely related with their polarization state. These results not only demonstrated that the polarized differentiation enhanced the maturity and liver function of hEHs, but also identified the molecular targets that regulated the polarization state of hEHs.",

The pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESC) is offering new opportunities in tissue engineering and cell therapy. We have shown previously that alveolar epithelial cells, specifically type II pneumocytes, can be derived from murine ESC and hypothesized that a similar protocol could be used successfully on human ESC. Undifferentiated human ESC were induced to form embryoid bodies that were transferred into adherent culture conditions and grown in a medium designed for the maintenance of mature small airway epithelium. On inverted microscopy, the generated cells showed the cobblestone-like morphology of epithelium. The presence of surfactant protein C, a specific marker of type II pneumocytes, and its corresponding RNA were demonstrated by immunostaining and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Electron microscopy revealed frequent cells with the typical ultrastructure of type II pneumocytes. This study provides evidence for in vitro induction of the differentiation from human ESC of alveolar type II cells, which have the potential for therapeutic use or construction of an in vitro model of human lung.",

The generation of hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) from iPSCs has resulted in a new source for liver cells. Since healthy primary human hepatocytes and hepatic cells are difficult to obtain, HLCs are gaining attention. HLCs can be obtained from a continuous, stable source while maintaining their original donor genotype, which opens new avenues into patient-specific testing and therapeutics. Studies have utilized HLCs for toxicity testing to further understand their drug metabolizing capabilities. This review focuses on advances being made to achieve hepatic functions from HLCs, their current use in hepatotoxicity testing, and their potential for future liver-related toxicity evaluations.",

        "abstract": "A novel 3D differentiation system for differentiating hESCs into hepatocyte-like cells by using alginate microcapsules to improve current hepatic differentiation, providing ready-to-use hESC-Heps. Background: The lack of a stable source of hepatocytes is one of major limitations in hepatocyte transplantation and clinical applications of a bioartificial liver. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) with a high degree of self-renewal and totipotency are a potentially limitless source of a variety of cell lineages, including hepatocytes. Many techniques have been developed for effective differentiation of hESCs into functional hepatocyte-like cells. However, the application of hESC-derived hepatocyte-like cells (hESC-Heps) in the clinic has been constrained by the low yield of fully differentiated cells, small-scale culture, difficulties in harvesting, and immunologic graft rejection. To resolve these shortcomings, we developed a novel 3D differentiation system involving alginate-microencapsulated spheres to improve current hepatic differentiation, providing ready-to-use hESC-Heps. Methods: In this study, we used alginate microencapsulation technology to differentiate human embryonic stem cells into hepatocyte-like cells (hESC-Heps). Hepatic markers of hESC-Heps were examined by qPCR and Western blotting, and hepatic functions of hESC-Heps were evaluated by indocyanine-green uptake and release, and ammonia removal. Results: The maturity and hepatic functions of the hESC-Heps derived from this 3D system were better than those derived from 2D culture. Hepatocyte-enriched genes, such as HNF4\u03b1, AFP, and ALB, were expressed at higher levels in 3D hESC-Heps than in 2D hESC-Heps. 3D hESC-Heps could metabolize indocyanine green and had better capacity to scavenge ammonia. In addition, the 3D sodium alginate hydrogel microspheres could block viral entry into the microspheres, and thus protect hESC-Heps in 3D microspheres from viral infection. Conclusion: We developed a novel 3D differentiation system for differentiating hESCs into hepatocyte-like cells by using alginate microcapsules.",

Face Recognition has been recognized as a major research field in pattern recognition and computer vision. This technique is widely adopted, because of its unique convenience, economy and high accuracy compared to other biological recognition techniques. An interesting and important challenge is thus to investigate high-efficient recognition algorithm. The introduction of kernel methods in pattern recognition has been received significant attentions in the recent several years, and gray kernel and graph kernel are two popular approaches.

        "abstract": "The results indicate that the natural aging process has profound effects on sperm methylation levels and this effect may be modified by environmental exposures and further support the role of epigenetic mechanisms as a likely link betwen paternal age and offspring health and development. Advanced paternal age at fertilization has been suggested to be a risk factor for neurodevelopmental, psychiatric and other disorders in offspring. One emerging hypothesis suggests that altered offspring phenotype is linked with age-related accumulation of epigenetic changes in the sperm of fathers. Given that paternal age is increasing in the developed world, understanding aging-related epigenetic changes in sperm is needed as well as environmental factors that modify such changes. In this study, we characterize age-dependent changes in sperm DNA methylation profiles between young pubertal (postnatal day (PNDs) 65) and mature (PND120) Wistar rats. We also analyze these changes in rats exposed perinatally to 0.2 mg/kg of ubiquitous environmental xenobiotic 2,2\u2019,4,4\u2019-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47). Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) libraries were prepared from caudal epididymal sperm DNA and differentially methylated regions (DMRs; \u2265 10x coverage depth, \u2265 3 CpGs per cluster, \u2265 5% methylation change, q < 0.05) were identified via MethPipe package. In control animals, 5,319 age-dependent DMRs were identified, with 99.3% DMRs hypermethylated in mature animals compared to young pubertal rats. These age-related DMRs were enriched for functional categories essential for embryonic development, such as pattern specification, forebrain and sensory organ development, Hippo and Wnt pathways. Age-related changes in sncRNA, reported in different study, target similar list of genes and biological categories.In BDE-47 exposed rats, sperm DNA methylation was higher in young pubertal and lower in mature animals when compared to controls, which resulted in a significant attenuation in the number of age-dependent DMRs (N = 189) identified in the exposed group. In conclusion, our results indicate that the natural aging process has profound effects on sperm methylation levels and this effect may be modified by environmental exposures. Moreover, our results further support the role of epigenetic mechanisms as a likely link betwen paternal age and offspring health and development.",

        "abstract": "Although the effects of 2 types of insulin sensitizer drugs, metformin and pioglitazone, on clinical, metabolic, and endocrine characteristics of women with PCOS are compared, there is a significant amelioration of endocrine and metabolic indices with piog litazone in PCOS patients. Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders in women. PCOS comprises a broad spectrum of anomalies, including hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, obesity, and infertility. Insulin resistance and its compensatory hyperinsulinemia play a key role in the pathogenicity of PCOS. This study compares the effects of 2 types of insulin sensitizer drugs, metformin and pioglitazone, on clinical, metabolic, and endocrine characteristics of women with PCOS. Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, 56 women with PCOS (ages 20\u201349 years) were treated orally with either metformin (500 mg 3 times daily) or pioglitazone (30 mg daily) for 3 months. Clinical (body weight, blood pressure [BP], and body mass index) and laboratory indices (fasting blood sugar [FBS], serum triglyceride [TG], cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, insulin, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]) were measured before and after therapy. Data were analyzed by Chi-square and McNemar's tests. Results: Significant decreases were seen after treatment with metformin in extent of hair loss (P = 0.008), wrist circle (P = 0.011), weight (P = 0.047), diastolic BP (P = 0.023), and DHEA (P = 0.035). A significant decrease in TG was seen with pioglitazone treatment (P = 0.047). In both groups, significant decreases in acne, menstrual disturbance, FBS, and serum insulin were seen. Conclusion: There is a significant amelioration of endocrine and metabolic indices with pioglitazone in PCOS patients. Although we were not able to recommend one treatment regime over the other, pioglitazone offers a useful, alternate treatment in women with PCOS who are not able to tolerate metformin.",

        "abstract": "In extensive experiments involving over 100 continuous passages, it is observed that both enzymatic passaging and feeder-free culture were associated with genetic instability, higher rates of cell proliferation, and persistence of OCT4/POU5F1-positive cells in teratomas, with enzyme passaging having the stronger effect. The self-renewal and differentiation capacities of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) make them a promising source of material for cell transplantation therapy, drug development, and studies of cellular differentiation and development. However, the large numbers of cells necessary for many of these applications require extensive expansion of hPSC cultures, a process that has been associated with genetic and epigenetic alterations. We have performed a combinatorial study on both hESCs and hiPSCs to compare the effects of enzymatic vs. mechanical passaging, and feeder-free vs. mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder substrate, on the genetic and epigenetic stability and the phenotypic characteristics of hPSCs. In extensive experiments involving over 100 continuous passages, we observed that both enzymatic passaging and feeder-free culture were associated with genetic instability, higher rates of cell proliferation, and persistence of OCT4/POU5F1-positive cells in teratomas, with enzymatic passaging having the stronger effect. In all combinations of culture conditions except for mechanical passaging on feeder layers, we noted recurrent deletions in the genomic region containing the tumor suppressor gene TP53, which was associated with decreased mRNA expression of TP53, as well as alterations in the expression of several downstream genes consistent with a decrease in the activity of the TP53 pathway. Among the hESC cultures, we also observed culture-associated variations in global gene expression and DNA methylation. The effects of enzymatic passaging and feeder-free conditions were also observed in hiPSC cultures. Our results highlight the need for careful assessment of the effects of culture conditions on cells intended for clinical therapies.",

        "abstract": "Exogenous genes could not sufficiently activate the essential endogenous genes and remodel the epigenetic milieu to achieve faithful pluripotency in pig, and DNA methylation analysis for promoters of OCT4, NANOG, and XIST showed that epigenetic reprogramming did not occur in female iPSCs. Cellular reprogramming of committed cells into a pluripotent state can be induced by ectopic expression of genes such as OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC. Reprogrammed cells can be maintained by activating endogenous pluripotent networks without transgene expression. Although various research groups have attempted to generate pig induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), authentic iPSCs have not be obtained, instead showing dependence on transgene expression. In this study, iPSCs were derived from porcine fetal fibroblasts via drug-inducible vectors carrying human transcription factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC). Therefore, this study investigated characteristics of iPSCs and reprogramming mechanisms in pig. The iPSCs were stably maintained over an extended period with potential in vitro differentiation into three germ layers. In addition, the pluripotent state of iPSCs was regulated by modulating culture conditions. They showed naive- or primed-like pluripotent states in LIF or bFGF supplemented culture conditions, respectively. However, iPSCs could not be maintained without ectopic expression of transgenes. The cultured iPSCs expressed endogenous transcription factors such as OCT4 and SOX2, but not NANOG (a known gateway to complete reprogramming). Endogenous genes related to mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (DPPA2, CDH1, EPCAM, and OCLN) were not sufficiently reactivated, as measured by qPCR. DNA methylation analysis for promoters of OCT4, NANOG, and XIST showed that epigenetic reprogramming did not occur in female iPSCs. Based on our results, expression of exogenous genes could not sufficiently activate the essential endogenous genes and remodel the epigenetic milieu to achieve faithful pluripotency in pig. Accordingly, investigating iPSCs could help us improve and develop reprogramming methods by understanding reprogramming mechanisms in pig.",

        "abstract": "It is shown that a hypomorphic mutation in pacman (pcm5) results in smaller wing imaginal discs, and a relatively small number of mRNAs and miRNAs substantially change in abundance in Pacman mutant wingimaginal discs. Pacman/Xrn1 is a highly conserved exoribonuclease known to play a critical role in gene regulatory events such as control of mRNA stability, RNA interference and regulation via miRNAs. Although Pacman has been well studied in Drosophila tissue culture cells, the biologically relevant cellular pathways controlled by Pacman in natural tissues are unknown. This study shows that a hypomorphic mutation in pacman (pcm5) results in smaller wing imaginal discs. These tissues, found in the larva, are known to grow and differentiate to form wing and thorax structures in the adult fly. Using microarray analysis, followed by quantitative RT-PCR, we show that eight mRNAs were increased in level by > 2-fold in the pcm5 mutant wing discs compared with the control. The levels of pre-mRNAs were tested for five of these mRNAs; four did not increase in the pcm5 mutant, showing that they are regulated at the post-transcriptional level and, therefore, could be directly affected by Pacman. These transcripts include one that encodes the heat shock protein Hsp67Bc, which is upregulated 11.9-fold at the post-transcriptional level and 2.3-fold at the protein level. One miRNA, miR-277-3p, is 5.6-fold downregulated at the post-transcriptional level in mutant discs, suggesting that Pacman affects its processing in this tissue. Together, these data show that a relatively small number of mRNAs and miRNAs substantially change in abundance in pacman mutant wing imaginal discs. Since Hsp67Bc is known to regulate autophagy and protein synthesis, it is possible that Pacman may control the growth of wing imaginal discs by regulating these processes.",

        "abstract": "The role of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and bioactive lipids and microvesicles released from cells employed as cellular therapeutics in regenerative medicine are discussed and it is suggested that paracrine effects make major contributions in most of the currently reported positive results in clinical trials employing adult stem cells. Although regenerative medicine is searching for pluripotent stem cells that could be employed for therapy, various types of more differentiated adult stem and progenitor cells are in meantime being employed in clinical trials to regenerate damaged organs (for example, heart, kidney or neural tissues). It is striking that, for a variety of these cells, the currently observed final outcomes of cellular therapies are often similar. This fact and the lack of convincing documentation for donor\u2013recipient chimerism in treated tissues in most of the studies indicates that a mechanism other than transdifferentiation of cells infused systemically into peripheral blood or injected directly into damaged organs may have an important role. In this review, we will discuss the role of (i) growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and bioactive lipids and (ii) microvesicles (MVs) released from cells employed as cellular therapeutics in regenerative medicine. In particular, stem cells are a rich source of these soluble factors and MVs released from their surface may deliver RNA and microRNA into damaged organs. Based on these phenomena, we suggest that paracrine effects make major contributions in most of the currently reported positive results in clinical trials employing adult stem cells. We will also present possibilities for how these paracrine mechanisms could be exploited in regenerative medicine to achieve better therapeutic outcomes. This approach may yield critical improvements in current cell therapies before true pluripotent stem cells isolated in sufficient quantities from adult tissues and successfully expanded ex vivo will be employed in the clinic.",

        "abstract": "The available data on the pluripotent state and the chimeric ability of rabbit PSCs are presented and the potential barriers that compromise their intended use as producers of germline-competent chimeras are examined and possible alternatives to exploit them for transgenesis are proposed. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) possess the following two main properties: self-renewal and pluripotency. Self-renewal is defined as the ability to proliferate in an undifferentiated state and pluripotency as the capacity to differentiate into cells of the three germ layers, i.e., ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. PSCs are derived from early embryos as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or are produced by reprogramming somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In mice, PSCs can be stabilized into two states of pluripotency, namely naive and primed. Naive and primed PSCs notably differ by their ability to colonize a host blastocyst to produce germline-competent chimeras; hence, naive PSCs are valuable for transgenesis, whereas primed PSCs are not. Thanks to its physiological and developmental peculiarities similar to those of primates, the rabbit is an interesting animal model for studying human diseases and early embryonic development. Both ESCs and iPSCs have been described in rabbits. They self-renew in the primed state of pluripotency and, therefore, cannot be used for transgenesis. This review presents the available data on the pluripotent state and the chimeric ability of these rabbit PSCs. It also examines the potential barriers that compromise their intended use as producers of germline-competent chimeras and proposes possible alternatives to exploit them for transgenesis.",

        "abstract": "By comprehensively analyzing miRNAs in 81 plant species phylogenetically ranging from chlorophytes to angiosperms, this work identified 8048 species-specific mi RNAs from 5499 families, representing over 61.2% of the miRNA families in the examined species. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an important class of regulatory small RNAs that program gene expression, mainly at the post-transcriptional level. Although sporadic examples of species-specific miRNAs (termed SS-miRNAs) have been reported, a genome-scale study across a variety of distant species has not been assessed. Here, by comprehensively analyzing miRNAs in 81 plant species phylogenetically ranging from chlorophytes to angiosperms, we identified 8048 species-specific miRNAs from 5499 families, representing over 61.2% of the miRNA families in the examined species. An analysis of the conservation from different taxonomic levels supported the high turnover rate of SS-miRNAs, even over short evolutionary distances. A comparison of the intrinsic features between SS-miRNAs and NSS-miRNAs (non-species-specific miRNAs) indicated that the AU content of mature miRNAs was the most striking difference. Our data further illustrated a significant bias of the genomic coordinates towards SS-miRNAs lying close to or within genes. By analyzing the 125,267 putative target genes for the 7966 miRNAs, we found the preferentially regulated functions of SS-miRNAs related to diverse metabolic processes. Collectively, these findings underscore the dynamic evolution of miRNAs in the species-specific lineages.",

        "abstract": "The more mature hiPSC-CMs produced by the methods described here will serve as a useful in vitro platform for characterizing cardiovascular disease. Rationale Human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are a powerful platform for biomedical research. However, they are immature, which is a barrier to modeling adult-onset cardiovascular disease. Objective We sought to develop a simple method which could drive cultured hiPSC-CMs towards maturity across a number of phenotypes. Methods and results Cells were cultured in fatty acid-based media and plated on micropatterned surfaces to promote alignment and elongation. These cells display many characteristics of adult human cardiomyocytes, including elongated cell morphology, enhanced maturity of sarcomeric structures, metabolic behavior, and increased myofibril contractile force. Most notably, hiPSC-CMs cultured under optimal maturity-inducing conditions recapitulate the pathological hypertrophy caused by either a pro-hypertrophic agent or genetic mutations. Conclusions The more mature hiPSC-CMs produced by the methods described here will serve as a useful in vitro platform for characterizing cardiovascular disease.",

        "abstract": "The self-renewal potential of pMSCs is controlled by WNT and VEGF/PDGF, but TGF\u03b2 and PI3K signaling induce senescence. Background Therapeutic use of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is hampered due to poor growth and limited self-renewal potential. The self-renewal potential of MSCs is also affected during propagation and changes are poorly understood. This study investigated the molecular mechanism involved in the self-renewal of primitive (p) MSCs. Methods pMSCs were cultured to low passage (LP), P3, and high passage (HP), P20, in fetal bovine serum medium (FM) and xeno-free medium (XM). The characteristics of LP and HP pMSCs were evaluated for morphology, expression of cell surface markers, doubling time (DT), colony forming efficiency (CFE), proliferation by BrdU assay, telomerase activity and trilineage differentiation. We then examined transcriptome and nucleosome occupancies using RNA-seq and MNase-seq, respectively analyses. Results pMSCs grown in FM gradually changed morphology to large elongated cells and showed a significant reduction in the expression of CD90 and CD49f, CFE, proliferation, and telomerase activity. In addition, cells had a greater propensity to differentiate into the adipogenic lineage. In contrast, pMSCs grown in XM maintained small fibroblastoid morphology, self-renewal, and differentiation potential. Transcriptomic analysis showed upregulation of genes involved in self-renewal, cell cycle, and DNA replication in XM-grown pMSCs. Whereas senescence genes were upregulated in cells in FM. MNase-seq analysis revealed less nucleosomal occupancies in self-renewal genes and senescence genes in pMSCs grown in XM and FM, respectively. The expression of selected genes associated with self-renewal, cell cycle, DNA replication, differentiation, and senescence was confirmed by qRT-PCR. These results led us to propose signaling pathways involved in the self-renewal and senescence of pMSCs. Conclusion We conclude that the self-renewal potential of pMSCs is controlled by WNT and VEGF/PDGF, but TGF\u03b2 and PI3K signaling induce senescence.",

        "abstract": "The effect of Activin/Nodal signaling on pluripotency and differentiation could be dictated by tissue specific Smad2/3 partners such as Nanog, explaining the mechanisms by which signaling pathways can orchestrate divergent cell fate decisions. Activin/Nodal signaling is necessary to maintain pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and to induce their differentiation toward endoderm. However, the mechanisms by which Activin/Nodal signaling achieves these opposite functions remain unclear. To unravel these mechanisms, we examined the transcriptional network controlled in hESCs by Smad2 and Smad3, which represent the direct effectors of Activin/Nodal signaling. These analyses reveal that Smad2/3 participate in the control of the core transcriptional network characterizing pluripotency, which includes Oct\u20104, Nanog, FoxD3, Dppa4, Tert, Myc, and UTF1. In addition, similar experiments performed on endoderm cells confirm that a broad part of the transcriptional network directing differentiation is downstream of Smad2/3. Therefore, Activin/Nodal signaling appears to control divergent transcriptional networks in hESCs and in endoderm. Importantly, we observed an overlap between the transcriptional network downstream of Nanog and Smad2/3 in hESCs; whereas, functional studies showed that both factors cooperate to control the expression of pluripotency genes. Therefore, the effect of Activin/Nodal signaling on pluripotency and differentiation could be dictated by tissue specific Smad2/3 partners such as Nanog, explaining the mechanisms by which signaling pathways can orchestrate divergent cell fate decisions.

        "abstract": "Simple Summary Culturing of muscle precursor cells\u2014satellite cells\u2014is the basis for research on obtaining meat using in vitro techniques, which can become an alternative to traditional meat production. The available literature data do not give a clear answer as to the medium used at the proliferation stage of bovine satellite cells; therefore, there is a need to select the level of components of the growth medium. In our research, based on the fluorometric measurement of proliferating cell growth and qPCR analysis, we examined the effect of the three most common components: glucose, serum (bovine or horse), and bFGF\u2014a mitogenic factor. The results show that the most critical component affecting the proliferation rate is the serum\u2014the addition of bovine serum, followed by the addition of bFGF\u2014at 10 ng/mL. In turn, the lower glucose content ensures the maintenance of cells at the early stage of myogenesis and, thus, the self-renewal of their population. In conclusion, a higher proliferation rate of bovine satellite cells is ensured under the conditions of bovine serum and a mitogenic factor at 10 ng/mL. Abstract It is predicted that already in 2040, 35% of requirements for meat will be provided by in vitro production. Recreating the course of myogenesis in vitro, and thus resembling a structure of muscle tissue, is the basis for research focusing on obtaining cultured meat and requires providing relevant factors supporting the proliferation of satellite cells\u2014being precursors of skeletal muscles. The present work aimed to develop the composition of the medium that would most effectively stimulate the proliferation of bovine satellite cells (BSCs). The modeling and optimization methods included the measurements of the synergistic, co-stimulatory effect of three medium components: the amount of glucose, the type of serum (bovine or horse), and the amount of mitogenic factor\u2014bFGF. Additionally, the qPCR analyses determined the expression of genes involved in myogenesis, such as Pax7 and Myogenic Regulatory Factors, depending on the level of the tested factor. The results showed significant positive effects of serum type (bovine serum) and mitogenic factor (addition of 10 ng/mL bFGF) on the proliferation rate. In turn, qPCR analysis displayed no significant differences in the relative expression level of Pax7 genes and MRF factors for both factors. However, a statistically higher Pax7 and Myf5 gene expression level was revealed when a low glucose medium was used (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the components of the medium, such as bovine serum and the addition of a mitogenic factor at the level of 10 ng/mL, ensure a higher proliferation rate of BSCs and lower glucose content ensured the expression of crucial genes in the self-renewal of the satellite cell population.",

        "abstract": "Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) hold the potential to solve the problem of the shortage of functional hepatocytes in clinical applications and drug development. However, a large number of usable hepatocytes derived from hESCs cannot be effectively obtained due to the limited proliferation capacity. In this study, we found that enhancement of liver transcription factor C/EBP\u03b2 during hepatic differentiation could not only significantly promote the expression of hepatic genes, such as albumin, alpha fetoprotein, and alpha-1 antitrypsin, but also dramatically reinforce proliferation-related phenotypes, including increasing the expression of proliferative genes, such as CDC25C, CDC45L, and PCNA, and the activation of cell cycle and DNA replication pathways. In addition, the analysis of CUT&Tag sequencing further revealed that C/EBP\u03b2 is directly bound to the promoter region of proliferating genes to promote cell proliferation; this interaction between C/EBP\u03b2 and DNA sequences of the promoters was verified by luciferase assay. On the contrary, the knockdown of C/EBP\u03b2 could significantly inhibit the expression of the aforementioned proliferative genes. RNA transcriptome analysis and GSEA enrichment indicated that the E2F family was enriched, and the expression of E2F2 was changed with the overexpression or knockdown of C/EBP\u03b2. Moreover, the results of CUT&Tag sequencing showed that C/EBP\u03b2 also directly bound the promoter of E2F2, regulating E2F2 expression. Interestingly, Co-IP analysis exhibited a direct binding between C/EBP\u03b2 and E2F2 proteins, and this interaction between these two proteins was also verified in the LO2 cell line, a hepatic progenitor cell line. Thus, our results demonstrated that C/EBP\u03b2 first initiated E2F2 expression and then coupled with E2F2 to regulate the expression of proliferative genes in hepatocytes during the differentiation of hESCs. Therefore, our findings open a new avenue to provide an in vitro efficient approach to generate proliferative hepatocytes to potentially meet the demands for use in cell-based therapeutics as well as for pharmaceutical and toxicological studies.",

        "abstract": "It is demonstrated that the genetically modified mESCs can be selectively differentiated into a homogenous population of functional ATIICs, providing a reliable cell source to explore their therapeutic potential in lung tissue regeneration. The use of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to regenerate distal lung epithelia damaged by injuries or diseases requires development of safe and efficient methodologies that direct ESC differentiation into transplantable distal lung epithelial progenitors. Time-consuming culture procedure and low differentiation efficiency are major problems that are associated with conventional differentiation approaches via embryoid body formation. The use of a growth factor cocktail or a lung-specific cell-conditioned medium to enrich definitive endoderm for efficient differentiation of mouse ESCs (mESC) into alveolar epithelial progenitor type II cells (ATIICs) has been reported, but not yet successful for generating a homogenous population of ATIICs for tissue regeneration purpose, and it remains unclear whether or not those mESC-derived ATIICs possess normal biological functions. Here, we report a novel method using a genetically modified mESC line harboring an ATIIC-specific neomycin(R) transgene in Rosa 26 locus. We showed that ATIICs can be efficiently differentiated from mESCs as early as day 7 by culturing them directly on Matrigel-coated plates in DMEM containing 15% knockout serum replacement. With this culture condition, the genetically modified mESCs can be selectively differentiated into a homogenous population (>99%) of ATIICs. Importantly, the mESC-derived ATIICs (mESC-ATIICs) exhibited typical lamellar bodies and expressed surfactant protein A, B, and C as normal control ATIICs. When cultured with an air-liquid-interface culture system in Small Airway Epithelial Cell Growth Medium, the mESC-ATIICs can be induced to secrete surfactant proteins after being treated with dibutyryl cAMP+dexamethasone. These mESC-ATIICs can synthesize and secrete surfactant lipid in response to secretagogue, demonstrating active surfactant metabolism in mESC-ATIICs as that seen in normal control ATIICs. In addition, we demonstrated that the selected mESC-ATIICs can be maintained on Matrigel-coated plates for at least 4 days with robust proliferative capacity. When cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, mESC-ATIICs spontaneously differentiated into alveolar epithelial type I cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the genetically modified mESCs can be selectively differentiated into a homogenous population of functional ATIICs, providing a reliable cell source to explore their therapeutic potential in lung tissue regeneration.",

        "abstract": "It is suggested that a new cryopreservation method using S1P pretreatment can enhance the overall quality ofcryopreserved MSCs by stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton and making them more suitable for various applications in regenerative medicine and cell therapy. : The actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role not only in maintaining cell shape and viability but also in homing/engraftment properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a valuable source of cell therapy. Therefore, during the cryopreservation process of MSCs, protecting the actin cytoskeleton from the freezing/thawing stress is critical in maintaining their functionality and therapeutic potential. In this study, the safety and cryoprotective potential of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which has a stabilizing effect on actin cytoskeleton, on dental pulp-derived MSCs (DP-MSCs) was investigated. Our results demonstrated that S1P treatment did not adversely affect viability and stemness of DP-MSCs. Furthermore, S1P pretreatment enhanced cell viability and proliferation properties of post-freeze/thaw DP-MSCs, protecting them against damage to the actin cytoskeleton and adhesion ability as well. These \ufb01ndings suggest that a new cryopreservation method using S1P pretreatment can enhance the overall quality of cryopreserved MSCs by stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton and making them more suitable for various applications in regenerative medicine and cell therapy.",

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) represent a promising and unlimited source of differentiated human hepatocytes. However, when obtained in two-dimensional (2D) cultures these hepatocytes are not fully mature and functional. As three-dimensional culture conditions offer advantageous strategies for differentiation, we describe here a combination of three-dimensional (3D) approaches enabling the successful differentiation of functional hepatocytes from hiPSCs by the encapsulation of hiPSC-derived hepatoblasts in alginate beads of preformed aggregates. The resulting encapsulated and differentiated hepatocytes (E-iHep-Orgs) displayed a high level of albumin synthesis associated with the disappearance of \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) synthesis, thus demonstrating that the E-iHep-Orgs had reached a high level of maturation, similar to that of adult hepatocytes. Gene expression analysis by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence confirmed this maturation. Further functional assessments demonstrated their enzymatic activities, including lactate and ammonia detoxification, as well as biotransformation activities of Phase I and Phase II enzymes. This study provides proof of concept regarding the benefits of combining three-dimensional techniques (guided aggregation and microencapsulation) with liver differentiation protocols as a robust approach to generate mature and functional hepatocytes that offer a permanent and unlimited source of hepatocytes. Based on these encouraging results, our combined conditions to produce mature hepatocytes from hiPSCs could be extended to liver tissue engineering and bioartificial liver (BAL) applications at the human scale for which large biomasses are mandatory.",

        "abstract": "The results indicate that the natural aging process has profound effects on sperm sncRNA profiles and this effect may be modified by environmental exposure. Advanced paternal age at fertilization is a risk factor for multiple disorders in offspring and may be linked to age-related epigenetic changes in the father\u2019s sperm. An understanding of aging-related epigenetic changes in sperm and environmental factors that modify such changes is needed. Here, we characterize changes in sperm small non-coding RNA (sncRNA) between young pubertal and mature rats. We also analyze the modification of these changes by exposure to environmental xenobiotic 2,2\u2032,4,4\u2032-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47). sncRNA libraries prepared from epididymal spermatozoa were sequenced and analyzed using DESeq 2. The distribution of small RNA fractions changed with age, with fractions mapping to rRNA and lncRNA decreasing and fractions mapping to tRNA and miRNA increasing. In total, 249 miRNA, 908 piRNA and 227 tRNA-derived RNA were differentially expressed (twofold change, false discovery rate (FDR) p \u2264 0.05) between age groups in control animals. Differentially expressed miRNA and piRNA were enriched for protein-coding targets involved in development and metabolism, while piRNA were enriched for long terminal repeat (LTR) targets. BDE-47 accelerated age-dependent changes in sncRNA in younger animals, decelerated these changes in older animals and increased the variance in expression of all sncRNA. Our results indicate that the natural aging process has profound effects on sperm sncRNA profiles and this effect may be modified by environmental exposure.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in premenopausal women. Insulin resistance and glucose intolerance are very prevalent metabolic complications in women with PCOS, especially in those presenting with weight excess. Therapeutic strategies targeting insulin resistance in PCOS are of interest because of their overall safety and their beneficial effects on metabolic and reproductive features. Areas covered: The authors review systematically all of the available therapeutic interventions targeting insulin resistance and/or disturbances of glucose metabolism in women with PCOS. Expert opinion: The diagnosis of glucose tolerance disorders in women with PCOS requires an oral glucose tolerance test. Strategies addressing weight excess and abdominal adiposity, from lifestyle modification to insulin sensitizers, may improve insulin resistance and glucose tolerance in women with PCOS. However, amelioration of signs and symptoms of PCOS usually requires the loss of large amounts of weight for it to be noticeable. Bariatric surgery has emerged as the most successful approach for obese patients with PCOS, because glucose intolerance, diabetes, and PCOS resolve in most cases through follow-ups. At present, the role of novel drugs targeting insulin resistance and/or diabetes such as inositols, berberine, resveratrol, and incretin-based therapies are yet to be properly established.",

        "abstract": "This study assessed the landscape of DNA methylation aberrations during prolonged culturing of hPSCs, and defined a set of genes which are recurrently hypermethylated and silenced, and demonstrated that when silenced, differentiation-related genes and tumor-suppressor genes are downregulated, while pluripotency- and growth promoting genes are upregulated. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are an important player in disease modeling and regenerative medicine. Nonetheless, multiple studies uncovered their inherent genetic instability upon prolonged culturing, where specific chromosomal aberrations provide cells with a growth advantage. These positively selected modifications have dramatic effects on multiple cellular characteristics. Epigenetic aberrations also possess the potential of changing gene expression and altering cellular functions. In the current study we assessed the landscape of DNA methylation aberrations during prolonged culturing of hPSCs, and defined a set of genes which are recurrently hypermethylated and silenced. We further focused on one of these genes, testis-specific Y-encoded like protein 5 (TSPYL5), and demonstrated that when silenced, differentiation-related genes and tumor-suppressor genes are downregulated, while pluripotency- and growth promoting genes are upregulated. This process is similar to the hypermethylation-mediated inactivation of certain genes during tumor development. Our analysis highlights the existence and importance of recurrent epigenetic aberrations in hPSCs during prolonged culturing.",

        "abstract": "Analysis of the cause of long-term culture failure by quantitative PCR confirmed that the expression of intermediate reprogramming markers was not maintained, and the understanding of pluripotent networks can be used to aid in the establishment of bona fide pig pluripotency stem cells. Establishing pig embryonic stem cells (pESCs) remains a challenge due to differences in the genetic backgrounds of mouse, human, and pig. Therefore, pig-specific pluripotency markers and cellular signaling must be identified. In this study, doxycycline (DOX)-inducible vectors carrying Oct4, sex-determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2), Nanog, Kruppel-like family 4 (Klf4), or Myc, which are known reprogramming factors, were transduced into pESCs. And pluripotency genes were analyzed in one or two reprogramming factor-expressed pESCs. When cultured without DOX, pESCs were stably maintained in basic fibroblast growth factor-supplemented media. However, when treated with DOX, the cells lost their alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity and differentiated within 2 weeks. Subsequently, we investigated the expression of genes related to pluripotency in DOX-treated pESCs using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Expression levels of Oct4, E-cadherin, and Fut4 were significantly increased by Oct4 overexpression, and Oct4 and Fut4 were upregulated in the Sox2-infected group. When a combination of two reprogramming factors, including Oct4 or Sox2, was introduced, weak AP activity remained. In addition, several of the two reprogramming factor transduction groups could be maintained after subculturing with transgene activation. Although long-term culture failed, pESCs transduced with Oct4 and Nanog, Oct4 and Klf4, or Sox2 and Nanog combinations could be subcultured even under transgene activation conditions. Analysis of the cause of long-term culture failure by quantitative PCR confirmed that the expression of intermediate reprogramming markers was not maintained. Given these results, additional methods are needed to support the completion of each reprogramming phase to succeed in the conversion of the pluripotent state of pESCs. This study improves our understanding of pluripotent networks and can be used to aid in the establishment of bona fide pig pluripotent stem cells.",

        "title": "The role of the exoribonuclease Pacman/Xrn1 in wing development in Drosophila",
        "abstract": "Results from this thesis show that Pacman is required for the correct growth and development of the wing imaginal discs of Drosophila melanogaster by regulating the expression of reaper and hid, and also shows that wing  imaginal disc cells have a cell autonomous requirement for Pacman. RNA stability plays a critical role in the control of gene regulation by determining the levels of mRNA that can be translated into protein. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the role of the exoribonuclease Pacman  in regulating gene expression during wing development  in Drosophila melanogaster.  Pacman  is  the only  known  cytoplasmic  exoribonuclease which degrades RNA in a 5\u2019\u20103\u2019 direction and is highly conserved across all eukaryotes. The main phenotype of null pacman mutants is that the wing imaginal discs are significantly smaller than wild\u2010type. The wing  imaginal discs are the parts of tissue  in the  larvae which go on to form the adult wings and are first specified  in the embryo. They are an excellent model  system  to  study  the  growth  and development of  a multi\u2010cellular organism  as  the pathways involved are highly conserved across eukaryotes, including humans. Results  from  this  thesis  show  that  Pacman  is  required  for  the  correct  growth  and development  of  the wing  imaginal  discs.  The  reduced  size  of  the wing  imaginal  discs  in pacman mutants was  shown  to be a direct  consequence of  the  lack of  cytoplasmic 5'\u20103' exoribonuclease activity within these cells. In addition to the mutant discs being smaller in size  they were  also delayed  in development. Knocking down pacman using RNAi, within specific regions of the disc, also leads to smaller wings and wing vein defects. Using mosaic analysis,  it was shown that wing  imaginal disc cells have a cell autonomous requirement  for Pacman. The  cause of  the  reduced growth and delayed development of pcm  wing  imaginal  discs  was  shown  to  be  an  increase  in  apoptosis.  Interestingly, compensatory  proliferation was  also  shown  to  be  occurring  in  these mutant  discs,  but clearly this was unable to compensate for the amount of apoptosis occurring. A genetic interaction was observed between pacman and the intrinsic apoptosis pathway in Drosophila.  In  order  to  determine  whether  Pacman  was  regulating  apoptosis  directly through  this pathway, q\u2010RT\u2010PCR was performed,  to determine whether any of  these pro\u2010 apoptotic genes were post\u2010transcriptionally up\u2010regulated. Results showed that both reaper and hid were significantly up\u2010regulated, by 8 and 2 fold respectively, in pcm wing imaginal disc cells, yet levels of pre\u2010reaper and pre\u2010hid were not significantly different to wild\u2010type. This therefore strongly supports the current hypothesis that Pacman is regulating apoptosis in Drosophila wing imaginal discs by regulating the expression of reaper and hid.

        "abstract": "This study provides fundamental insight into the molecular basis for lineage segregation in post-implantation mouse embryos and discovered a subpopulation of mesoderm cells that possess molecular features of the extraembryonic Mesoderm. The mammalian post-implantation embryo has been extensively investigated at the tissue level. However, to unravel the molecular basis for the cell-fate plasticity and determination, it is essential to study the characteristics of individual cells. In particular, the individual definitive endoderm (DE) cells have not been characterized in vivo. Here, we report gene expression patterns in single cells freshly isolated from mouse embryos on days 5.5 and 6.5. Initial transcriptome data from 124 single cells yielded signature genes for the epiblast, visceral endoderm, and extra-embryonic ectoderm and revealed a unique distribution pattern of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligands and receptors. Further analysis indicated that early-stage epiblast cells do not segregate into lineages of the major germ layers. Instead, some cells began to diverge from epiblast cells, displaying molecular features of the premesendoderm by expressing higher levels of mesendoderm markers and lower levels of Sox3 transcripts. Analysis of single-cell high-throughput quantitative RT-PCR data from 441 cells identified a late stage of the day 6.5 embryo in which mesoderm and DE cells emerge, with many of them coexpressing Oct4 and Gata6. Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequence data from 112 cells of the late-stage day 6.5 embryos revealed differentially expressed signaling genes and networks of transcription factors that might underlie the segregation of the mesoderm and DE lineages. Moreover, we discovered a subpopulation of mesoderm cells that possess molecular features of the extraembryonic mesoderm. This study provides fundamental insight into the molecular basis for lineage segregation in post-implantation mouse embryos.",

        "abstract": "There is evidence that adult tissues harbor a promising population of very rare dormant stem cells with broad differentiation potential, and in this review, various potential sources of stem cells for regenerative medicine and the mechanisms that explain some of their beneficial effects are discussed. Regenerative medicine is searching for stem cells that can be safely and efficiently employed for regeneration of damaged solid organs (e.g., the heart, brain, or liver). Ideal for this purpose would be pluripotent stem cells, which, according to their definition, have broad potential to differentiate into all types of adult cells. For almost 20 years, there have been unsuccessful attempts to harness controversial embryonic stem cells (ESCs) isolated from embryos. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), generated by genetic modification of adult somatic cells, are a more promising source. However, both iPSC and ESCs are associated with a risk of teratoma formation. At the same time, various types of more\u2011differentiated adult stem and progenitor cells derived from the bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, mobilized peripheral blood, or fat tissue are being employed in clinical trials to regenerate damaged solid organs. However, for most of these cells, there is a lack of convincing documentation for successful regeneration of the treated organs. Beneficial effects of those cells might be explained by paracrine effects of growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, bioactive lipids, and extracellular microvesicles, which are released from the cells and have trophic, antiapoptotic, and angiopoietic effects. Nevertheless, there is evidence that adult tissues harbor a promising population of very rare dormant stem cells with broad differentiation potential. In this review, we will discuss various potential sources of stem cells for regenerative medicine and the mechanisms that explain some of their beneficial effects as well as highlight the results of the first clinical trials. \u00a0",

        "abstract": "The results indicate that the deletion of ATM and p53 downstream of miR-18a is closely associated with the development of lymphoma, and these biomarkers may serve as key prognostic biomarkers for lymphomas. microRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding, endogenous, small-molecule RNAs. They are involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism. Additionally, they play an essential role in the development and progression of various malignancies. Recent research has revealed that miR-18a plays an important role in cancer development. However, its role in lymphoma is not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigated the clinicopathological characteristics and potential functional roles of miR-18a in lymphomas. First, we predicted the potential downstream genes of miR-18a using miRTarBase software and subjected these downstream genes to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses to determine the potential mechanisms of action of these genes. We found that these target genes were closely related to cellular senescence, the p53 signaling pathway, and other signaling pathways. From the predicted downstream target genes, ATM and p53 were selected as the target genes; their deletion in patients with lymphoma was detected using the fluorescence in situ hybridization technique. The results showed that some patients with lymphoma have a deletion of the ATM and p53 genes. In addition, the deletion rates of ATM and p53 were positively correlated with the expression of miR-18a. Next, the expression levels of miR-18a and the deletion rates of ATM and p53 were used for correlation and prognostic analyses with patient clinical information. The findings revealed a significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) between patients with lymphoma with ATM deletion and those with a normal ATM gene expression (p < 0.001). Moreover, a significant difference in overall survival (OS) and DFS between patients with p53 deletion and those with normal p53 expression was observed (p < 0.001). The results indicate that the deletion of ATM and p53 downstream of miR-18a is closely associated with the development of lymphoma. Thus, these biomarkers may serve as key prognostic biomarkers for lymphomas.",

        "abstract": "An array of ECM proteins that were expressed during retinogenesis are identified and further characterization of these proteins will lead to a better understanding of retinal development. Background: Human tissue/organ development is a complex, highly orchestrated process, regulated in part by the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). Every complex tissue, including the retina, has a unique ECM configuration that plays a critical role in cellular differentiation, adhesion, migration, and maturation. \nAim: To characterize ECM expression of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived optic vesicles (iPSC-OVs). \nMethods: A 3- dimensional (3D) in vitro suspension culture system was used to direct differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into optic vesicles (OVs). Stepwise differentiation of iPSCs into retinal progenitor cells was confirmed by sequential expression of OTX2, SOX1, SIX6, LHX2, PAX6, and CHX10. Expression of ECM genes in iPSC-derived OVs was analyzed by RT2 ProfilerTM PCR Array, whereas immunofluorescence staining was performed to detect ECM proteins in the OVs. \nResults: A number of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) previously reported to be abundantly expressed in iPSCs such as E-cadherin, Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1), Integrin-\u03b1 L, Integrin-\u03b1 M, Integrin-\u03b1 6 were downregulated while neural and retina specific CAMs including neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1), neural plakophilin-related armadillo repeat protein (NPRAP), Integrin-\u03b1 1 and Integrin-\u03b1 4 were upregulated. Several glycoproteins that have been reported to play key roles during retinogenesis, namely CD44, Tenascin C, Tenascin R, Neurocan, Neuroglycan C, Delta 2 Catenin, Vitronectin, and Reelin were also present. \nConclusion: We have identified an array of ECM proteins that were expressed during retinogenesis. Further characterization of these proteins will lead to a better understanding of retinal development.",

        "abstract": "Human MSCs subjected to extensive in-vitro passage can undergo morphological, phenotypic, and genetic changes, which are modulated by the medium composition employed to expand the cell populations. BackgroundAdult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold great promise for regenerative medicine because of their self-renewal, multipotency, and trophic and immunosuppressive effects. Due to the rareness and high heterogeneity of freshly isolated MSCs, extensive in-vitro passage is required to expand their populations prior to clinical use; however, senescence usually accompanies and can potentially affect MSC characteristics and functionality. Therefore, a thorough characterization of the variations in phenotype and differentiation potential of in-vitro aging MSCs must be sought.MethodsHuman bone marrow-derived MSCs were passaged in vitro and cultivated with either DMEM-based or \u03b1MEM-based expansion media. Cells were prepared for subculture every 10\u00a0days up to passage 8 and were analyzed for cell morphology, proliferative capacity, and surface marker expression at the end of each passage. The gene expression profile and adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation capability of MSCs at early (passage 4) and late (passage 8) passages were also evaluated.ResultsIn-vitro aging MSCs gradually lost the typical fibroblast-like spindle shape, leading to elevated morphological abnormality and inhomogeneity. While the DMEM-based expansion medium better facilitated MSC proliferation in the early passages, the cell population doubling rate reduced over time in both DMEM and \u03b1MEM groups. CD146 expression decreased with increasing passage number only when MSCs were cultured under the DMEM-based condition. Senescence also resulted in MSCs with genetic instability, which was further regulated by the medium recipe. Regardless of the expansion condition, MSCs at both passages 4 and 8 could differentiate into adipocyte-like cells whereas osteogenesis of aged MSCs was significantly compromised. For osteogenic induction, use of the \u03b1MEM-based expansion medium yielded longer osteogenesis and better quality.ConclusionsHuman MSCs subjected to extensive in-vitro passage can undergo morphological, phenotypic, and genetic changes. These properties are also modulated by the medium composition employed to expand the cell populations. In addition, adipogenic potential may be better preserved over osteogenesis in aged MSCs, suggesting that MSCs at early passages must be used for osteogenic differentiation. The current study presents valuable information for future basic science research and clinical applications leading to the development of novel MSC-based therapeutic strategies for different diseases.",

        "abstract": "This work shows that SNON predominantly associates with SMAD2 at the promoters of primitive streak (PS) and early DE marker genes, and provides novel mechanistic insight into how a single signaling pathway both regulates pluripotency and directs lineage commitment. Activin/Nodal signaling via SMAD2/3 maintains human embryonic stem cell (hESC) pluripotency by direct transcriptional regulation of NANOG or, alternatively, induces mesoderm and definitive endoderm (DE) formation. In search of an explanation for these contrasting effects, we focused on SNON (SKIL), a potent SMAD2/3 corepressor that is expressed in hESCs but rapidly down-regulated upon differentiation. We show that SNON predominantly associates with SMAD2 at the promoters of primitive streak (PS) and early DE marker genes. Knockdown of SNON results in premature activation of PS and DE genes and loss of hESC morphology. In contrast, enforced SNON expression inhibits DE formation and diverts hESCs toward an extraembryonic fate. Thus, our findings provide novel mechanistic insight into how a single signaling pathway both regulates pluripotency and directs lineage commitment.",

Developing robust in vitro models of the liver is essential for studying the pathogenesis of liver diseases, hepatotoxicity testing, and regenerative medicine. Earlier studies were conducted using cell lines derived from hepatomas. Due to the inherent limitations of cell lines, researchers used primary human hepatocytes (PHHs), which are considered a gold standard for in vitro modeling of the liver. However, due to the high cost of PHHs and lack of donors, researchers have sought an alternative source for functional liver cells. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) emerged as a viable alternative due to their plasticity and high proliferative capacity. This review gives an overview of the major advances that have been achieved to develop protocols to generate liver cells such as hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, and K\u00fcpffer cells from PSCs. We also discuss their application in modeling the pathogenesis of liver diseases such as drug\u2010induced liver injury, acute liver failure, and hepatic steatosis.",

The use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) in animal cell culture media is widely spread since it provides a broad spectrum of molecules that are known to support cell attachment and growth. However, the harvest and collection procedures of FBS raise ethical concerns and serum is an ill-defined and expensive component. This is especially problematic when it comes to regulatory approval for food applications like cultured meat. The aim of this study is to develop a chemically defined, cost efficient serum-free and animal-free medium that supports the attachment and expansion of bovine myoblasts while maintaining their differentiation capacity. Bovine satellite cells were harvested and isolated from a fresh sample of skeletal muscle tissue and cultured in planar systems. The efficacy of the tested formulations was assessed with metabolic assays and cell counting techniques. Optical microscopy was used to observe cellular morphology and statistical analysis was applied. Based on a comprehensive literature analysis, a defined serum-free medium (SFM) composition was developed consisting of DMEM/F12 as basal medium, supplemented with L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, fibronectin, hydrocortisone, GlutaMAX\u2122, albumin, ITS-X, hIL-6, \u03b1-linolenic acid, and growth factors such as FGF-2, VEGF, IGF-1, HGF, and PDGF-BB. To our knowledge, this is the first defined serum-free and animal free medium formulation specific for bovine myoblasts to date. We conclude that the SFM formulation supported exponential cell growth up to 97% of the serum\u2014containing golden standard growth medium. All reagents used in this study are chemically defined.",

        "abstract": "It is demonstrated that c/EBP\u03b1 and c-EBP\u03b2 determine the lineage commitment of hepatoblasts by negatively and positively regulating the expression of a common target gene, TGFBR2, respectively. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and their derivatives are expected to be used in drug discovery, regenerative medicine and the study of human embryogenesis. Because hepatocyte differentiation from hESCs has the potential to recapitulate human liver development in vivo, we employed this differentiation method to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying human hepatocyte differentiation. A previous study has shown that a gradient of transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) signaling is required to segregate hepatocyte and cholangiocyte lineages from hepatoblasts. Although CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (c/EBPs) are known to be important transcription factors in liver development, the relationship between TGF\u03b2 signaling and c/EBP-mediated transcriptional regulation in the hepatoblast fate decision is not well known. To clarify this relationship, we examined whether c/EBPs could determine the hepatoblast fate decision via regulation of TGF\u03b2 receptor 2 (TGFBR2) expression in the hepatoblast-like cells differentiated from hESCs. We found that TGFBR2 promoter activity was negatively regulated by c/EBP\u03b1 and positively regulated by c/EBP\u03b2. Moreover, c/EBP\u03b1 overexpression could promote hepatocyte differentiation by suppressing TGFBR2 expression, whereas c/EBP\u03b2 overexpression could promote cholangiocyte differentiation by enhancing TGFBR2 expression. Our findings demonstrated that c/EBP\u03b1 and c/EBP\u03b2 determine the lineage commitment of hepatoblasts by negatively and positively regulating the expression of a common target gene, TGFBR2, respectively.",

        "abstract": "It is suggested that the extent of hypoxia and careful timing may be important components of in vitro differentiation bioprocesses for the differential generation of distal lung epithelial cells from pluripotent progenitors. We investigated the effects of hypoxia on spontaneous (SP)- and activin A (AA)-induced definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and their subsequent differentiation into distal pulmonary epithelial cells. SP differentiation for 6 days of mESCs toward endoderm at hypoxia of 1% O2, but not at 3% or 21% (normoxia), increased the expression of Sox17 and Foxa2 by 31- and 63-fold above maintenance culture, respectively. Treatment of mESCs with 20 ng/mL AA for 6 days under hypoxia further increased the expression of DE marker genes Sox17, Foxa2, and Cxcr4 by 501-, 1,483-, and 126-fold above maintenance cultures, respectively. Transient exposure to hypoxia, as short as 24\u2009h, was sufficient to enhance AA-induced endoderm formation. The involvement of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the AA-induced endoderm enrichment was assessed using HIF-1\u03b1(-/-) mESCs and the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Under SP conditions, HIF-1\u03b1(-/-) mESCs failed to increase the expression of endodermal marker genes but rather shifted toward ectoderm. Hypoxia induced only a marginal potentiation of AA-induced endoderm differentiation in HIF-1\u03b1(-/-) mESCs. Treatment of mESCs with AA and NAC led to a dose-dependent decrease in Sox17 and Foxa2 expression. In addition, the duration of exposure to hypoxia in the course of a recently reported lung differentiation protocol resulted in differentially enhanced expression of distal lung epithelial cell marker genes aquaporin 5 (Aqp5), surfactant protein C (Sftpc), and secretoglobin 1a1 (Scgb1a1) for alveolar epithelium type I, type II, and club cells, respectively. Our study is the first to show the effects of in vitro hypoxia on efficient formation of DE and lung lineages. We suggest that the extent of hypoxia and careful timing may be important components of in vitro differentiation bioprocesses for the differential generation of distal lung epithelial cells from pluripotent progenitors.",

        "abstract": "The application fields including transplant and regeneration, disease models and drug cytotoxicity analysis, and advanced processing techniques for building vascularized microenvironments, including bioassembly, bioprinting and microfluidic methods are summarized. Abstract The occurrence of various liver diseases can lead to organ failure of the liver, which is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Liver tissue engineering see the potential for replacing liver transplantation and drug toxicity studies facing donor shortages. The basic elements in liver tissue engineering are cells and biomaterials. Both mature hepatocytes and differentiated stem cells can be used as the main source of cells to construct spheroids and organoids, achieving improved cell function. To mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM) environment, biomaterials need to be biocompatible and bioactive, which also help support cell proliferation and differentiation and allow ECM deposition and vascularized structures formation. In addition, advanced manufacturing approaches are required to construct the extracellular microenvironment, and it has been proved that the structured three-dimensional culture system can help to improve the activity of hepatocytes and the characterization of specific proteins. In summary, we review biomaterials for liver tissue engineering, including natural hydrogels and synthetic polymers, and advanced processing techniques for building vascularized microenvironments, including bioassembly, bioprinting and microfluidic methods. We then summarize the application fields including transplant and regeneration, disease models and drug cytotoxicity analysis. In the end, we put the challenges and prospects of vascularized liver tissue engineering.",

        "abstract": "This proof-of-concept study provides a simple yet robust approach to improve the engraftment of iPS-H and may be applicable to many stem cell-based therapies. Cellular therapies for liver diseases and in vitro models for drug testing both require functional human hepatocytes (Hum-H), which have unfortunately been limited due to the paucity of donor liver tissues. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) represent a promising and potentially unlimited cell source to derive Hum-H. However, the hepatic functions of these hPSC-derived cells to date are not fully comparable to adult Hum-H and are more similar to fetal ones. In addition, it has been challenging to obtain functional hepatic engraftment of these cells with prior studies having been done in immunocompromised animals. In this report, we demonstrated successful engraftment of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hepatocyte-like cells (iPS-H) in immunocompetent mice by pre-engineering 3D cell co-aggregates with stromal cells (SCs) followed by encapsulation in recently developed biocompatible hydrogel capsules. Notably, upon transplantation, human albumin and \u03b11-antitrypsin (A1AT) in mouse sera secreted by encapsulated iPS-H/SCs aggregates reached a level comparable to the primary Hum-H/SCs control. Further immunohistochemistry of human albumin in retrieved cell aggregates confirmed the survival and function of iPS-H. This proof-of-concept study provides a simple yet robust approach to improve the engraftment of iPS-H and may be applicable to many stem cell-based therapies.",

        "abstract": "A broader discussion focused on regulation of the father\u2019s age in natural and ART conceptions is needed and the professional community should be informed and should raise awareness in the population and when counseling older men. Abstract BACKGROUND Modern reproductive behavior in most developed countries is characterized by delayed parenthood. Older gametes are generally less fertile, accumulating and compounding the effects of varied environmental exposures that are modified by lifestyle factors. Clinicians are primarily concerned with advanced maternal age, while the influence of paternal age on fertility, early development and offspring health remains underappreciated. There is a growing trend to use assisted reproductive technologies for couples of advanced reproductive age. Thus, the number of children born from older gametes is increasing. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE We review studies reporting age-associated epigenetic changes in mammals and humans in sperm, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs. The interplay between environment, fertility, ART and age-related epigenetic signatures is explored. We focus on the association of sperm epigenetics on epigenetic and phenotype events in embryos and offspring. SEARCH METHODS Peer-reviewed original and review articles over the last two decades were selected using PubMed and the Web of Science for this narrative review. Searches were performed by adopting the two groups of main terms. The first group included \u2018advanced paternal age\u2019, \u2018paternal age\u2019, \u2018postponed fatherhood\u2019, \u2018late fatherhood\u2019, \u2018old fatherhood\u2019 and the second group included \u2018sperm epigenetics\u2019, \u2018sperm\u2019, \u2018semen\u2019, \u2019epigenetic\u2019, \u2018inheritance\u2019, \u2018DNA methylation\u2019, \u2018chromatin\u2019, \u2018non-coding RNA\u2019, \u2018assisted reproduction\u2019, \u2018epigenetic clock\u2019. OUTCOMES Age is a powerful factor in humans and rodent models associated with increased de novo mutations and a modified sperm epigenome. Age affects all known epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and profiles of small non-coding (snc)RNA. While DNA methylation is the most investigated, there is a controversy about the direction of age-dependent changes in differentially hypo- or hypermethylated regions with advanced age. Successful development of the human sperm epigenetic clock based on cross-sectional data and four different methods for DNA methylation analysis indicates that at least some CpG exhibit a linear relationship between methylation levels and age. Rodent studies show a significant overlap between genes regulated through age-dependent differentially methylated regions and genes targeted by age-dependent sncRNA. Both age-dependent epigenetic mechanisms target gene networks enriched for embryo developmental, neurodevelopmental, growth and metabolic pathways. Thus, age-dependent changes in the sperm epigenome cannot be described as a stochastic accumulation of random epimutations and may be linked with autism spectrum disorders. Chemical and lifestyle exposures and ART techniques may affect the epigenetic aging of sperm. Although most epigenetic modifications are erased in the early mammalian embryo, there is growing evidence that an altered offspring epigenome and phenotype is linked with advanced paternal age due to the father\u2019s sperm accumulating epigenetic changes with time. It has been hypothesized that age-induced changes in the sperm epigenome are profound, physiological and dynamic over years, yet stable over days and months, and likely irreversible. WIDER IMPLICATIONS This review raises a concern about delayed fatherhood and age-associated changes in the sperm epigenome that may compromise reproductive health of fathers and transfer altered epigenetic information to subsequent generations. Prospective studies using healthy males that consider confounders are recommended. We suggest a broader discussion focused on regulation of the father\u2019s age in natural and ART conceptions is needed. The professional community should be informed and should raise awareness in the population and when counseling older men.",

        "abstract": "Monkey models are most comprehensive, while mouse models provide molecular insight, including identifying the androgen receptor, particularly in neurons, as mediating androgen-induced PCOS-like programming. ABSTRACT Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosis comprises combinations of female hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularity and polycystic ovaries. While it is a familial and highly prevalent endocrine disorder, progress towards a cure is hindered by absence of a definitive pathogenic mechanism and lack of an animal model of naturally occurring PCOS. Areas covered: These include an overview of PCOS and its potential etiology, and an examination of insights gained into its pathogenic origins. Animal models derived from experimentally-induced hyperandrogenism during gestation, or from naturally-occurring PCOS-like traits, most reliably demonstrate reproductive, neuroendocrine and metabolic pathogenesis. Expert opinion: Genetic studies, while identifying at least 17 PCOS risk genes, account for <10% of women with PCOS. A number of PCOS risk genes involve regulation of gonadotropin secretion or action, suggesting a reproductive neuroendocrine basis for PCOS pathogenesis. Consistent with this notion, a number of animal models employing fetal androgen excess demonstrate epigenetic induction of PCOS-like traits, including reproductive neuroendocrine and metabolic dysfunction. Monkey models are most comprehensive, while mouse models provide molecular insight, including identifying the androgen receptor, particularly in neurons, as mediating androgen-induced PCOS-like programming. Naturally-occurring female hyperandrogenism is also demonstrated in monkeys. Animal models are poised to delineate molecular gateways to PCOS pathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are being increasingly utilized worldwide in investigating human development, and modeling and discovering therapies for a wide range of diseases as well as a source for cellular therapy. Yet, since the first isolation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) 20 years ago, followed by the successful reprogramming of human\u2010induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) 10 years later, various studies shed light on abnormalities that sometimes accumulate in these cells in vitro. Whereas genetic aberrations are well documented, epigenetic alterations are not as thoroughly discussed. In this review, we highlight frequent epigenetic aberrations found in hPSCs, including alterations in DNA methylation patterns, parental imprinting, and X chromosome inactivation. We discuss the potential origins of these abnormalities in hESCs and hiPSCs, survey the different methods for detecting them, and elaborate on their potential consequences for the different utilities of hPSCs.",

        "abstract": "It is found that porcine bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (PBMSCs) have higher efficiency on piPSC induction, and the culture condition of CHIR99021+PD0325901(2i)+Lif+bFGF is more suitable for subculturing of piPSCs. Past researches have shown that pluripotency maintenance of naive and primed-state pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) depends on different signaling pathways, and naive-state PSCs possess the ability to produce chimeras when they are introduced into a blastocyst. Considering porcine is an attractive model for preclinical studies, many researches about pig induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSCs) have been reported. Some cytokines and small molecule compounds could transform primed piPSCs into naive state. However, there are no suitable culture conditions for generation of naive-state piPSCs with high efficiency; other small molecule compounds need further exploration. In this study, we investigated whether p38 MAPK and JNK signal pathway inhibitor SB203580 and SP600125 could be of benefit for acquiring naive-state piPSCs. By comparing reprogramming efficiencies under conditions of different donor cells and culture environment, we found that porcine bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (PBMSCs) have higher efficiency on piPSC induction, and the culture condition of CHIR99021+PD0325901(2i)+Lif+bFGF is more suitable for subculturing of piPSCs. Our results also indicate that SB203580 and SP600125 could promote reprogramming of PBMSCs into naive-like state piPSCs. These results provide guidance for choosing donor cells, culture conditions, and research of different state iPSCs during the process of reprogramming pig somatic cells.",

        "abstract": "This work provides the first description of the molecular and developmental consequences of Dis3L2 inactivation in a non-human animal model, directly relevant to the understanding of human overgrowth syndromes such as Perlman syndrome. ABSTRACT In a complex organism, cell proliferation and apoptosis need to be precisely controlled in order for tissues to develop correctly. Excessive cell proliferation can lead to diseases such as cancer. We have shown that the exoribonuclease Dis3L2 is required for the correct regulation of proliferation in a natural tissue within the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Dis3L2 is a member of a highly conserved family of exoribonucleases that degrade RNA in a 3\u2032-5\u2032 direction. We show that knockdown of dis3L2 in the Drosophila wing imaginal discs results in substantial wing overgrowth due to increased cellular proliferation rather than an increase in cell size. Imaginal discs are specified in the embryo before proliferating and differentiating to form the adult structures of the fly. Using RNA-seq we identified a small set of mRNAs that are sensitive to Dis3L2 activity. Of the mRNAs which increase in levels and are therefore potential targets of Dis3L2, we identified 2 that change at the post-transcriptional level but not at the transcriptional level, namely CG2678 (a transcription factor) and pyrexia (a TRP cation channel). We also demonstrate a compensatory effect between Dis3L2 and the 5\u2032-3\u2032 exoribonuclease Pacman demonstrating that these 2 exoribonucleases function to regulate opposing pathways within the developing tissue. This work provides the first description of the molecular and developmental consequences of Dis3L2 inactivation in a non-human animal model. The work is directly relevant to the understanding of human overgrowth syndromes such as Perlman syndrome.",

        "abstract": "Improvements in single-cell technologies are transforming the understanding of mammalian development, not only by overcoming the limitations presented by the extremely low cell numbers of early embryos but also by enabling the study of cell fate specification in greater detail. During mammalian embryonic development, a single fertilized egg cell will proliferate and differentiate into all the cell lineages and cell types that eventually form the adult organism. Cell lineage diversification involves repeated cell fate choices that ultimately occur at the level of the individual cell rather than at the cell-population level. Improvements in single-cell technologies are transforming our understanding of mammalian development, not only by overcoming the limitations presented by the extremely low cell numbers of early embryos but also by enabling the study of cell fate specification in greater detail. In this Review, we first discuss recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics and imaging and provide a brief outline of current bioinformatics methods available to analyse the resulting data. We then discuss how these techniques have contributed to our understanding of pre-implantation and early post-implantation development and of in vitro pluripotency. Finally, we overview the current challenges facing single-cell research and highlight the latest advances and potential future avenues.Single-cell technologies are transforming our understanding of pre-implantation and early post-implantation development and of in vitro pluripotency. Specifically, single-cell transcriptomics and imaging and the accompanying bioinformatics methods have enabled precision interrogation of cell fate choices and cell lineage diversification, which occur at the level of the individual cell.",

In recent years, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been considered as a promising approach in the field of regenerative medicine. iPSCs can be generated from patients\u2019 somatic cells and possess the potential to differentiate, under proper conditions, into any cell type. However, the clinical application of iPS cells is restricted because of their tumorigenic potential. Recent studies have indicated that stem cells exert their therapeutic benefit via a paracrine mechanism, and extracellular vesicles have been demonstrated that play a critical role in this paracrine mechanism. Due to lower immunogenicity, easier management, and presenting no risk of tumor formation, in recent years, researchers turned attention to exosomes as potential alternatives to whole\u2010cell therapy. Application of exosomes derived from iPSCs and their derived precursor provides a promising approach for personalized regenerative medicine. This study reviews the physiological functions of extracellular vesicles and discusses their potential therapeutic benefit in regenerative medicine.",

        "abstract": "The data demonstrated the efficacy of a CRYO3-based medium containing 4% DMSO for the cryopreservation of skin tissues and rbiPSCs, and represents an encouraging first step towards the use of iPSCs for species preservation. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are obtained by genetically reprogramming adult somatic cells via the overexpression of specific pluripotent genes. The resulting cells possess the same differentiation properties as blastocyst-stage embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and can be used to produce new individuals by embryonic complementation, nuclear transfer cloning, or in vitro fertilization after differentiation into male or female gametes. Therefore, iPSCs are highly valuable for preserving biodiversity and, together with somatic cells, can enlarge the pool of reproductive samples for cryobanking. In this study, we subjected rabbit iPSCs (rbiPSCs) and rabbit ear tissues to several cryopreservation conditions with the aim of defining safe and non-toxic slow-freezing protocols. We compared a commercial synthetic medium (STEM ALPHA.CRYO3) with a biological medium based on fetal bovine serum (FBS) together with low (0\u20135%) and high (10%) concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Our data demonstrated the efficacy of a CRYO3-based medium containing 4% DMSO for the cryopreservation of skin tissues and rbiPSCs. Specifically, this medium provided similar or even better biological results than the commonly used freezing medium composed of FBS and 10% DMSO. The results of this study therefore represent an encouraging first step towards the use of iPSCs for species preservation.",

        "abstract": "It is currently evident that the expression of the miR-17-92 cluster is upregulated in a wide range of tumor cells and cancer types; thus, this cluster has been identified as a potential oncogene. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of short, single-stranded non-coding RNAs, regulate and control gene expression in eukaryotes by degrading mRNA at the post-transcriptional level. Regulation by miRNAs involves a plethora of biological processes, such as cell differentiation, proliferation, metastasis, metabolism, apoptosis, tumorigenesis and others. miRNAs also represent a powerful tool in disease diagnosis and prognosis. The miR-17-92 cluster, one of the most extensively investigated microRNA clusters, comprises six mature miRNA members, including miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20a and miR-92a. Originally identified as being involved in tumorigenesis, it is currently evident that the expression of the miR-17-92 cluster is upregulated in a wide range of tumor cells and cancer types; thus, this cluster has been identified as a potential oncogene. Considering the growing interest in the field of miR-17-92 research, we herein review recent advances in the expression and regulation of this cluster in various cancer cells, discuss the proposed mechanism of action for tumorigenesis and tumor development, and propose clinical and therapeutic applications for miR-17-92 cluster members, such as potential cancer biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "It is suggested that various treatment conditions allow the formulation of unique ESC-ECM derived scaffolds to enhance ESC bioactivities, including proliferation and differentiation for tissue regeneration applications. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have emerged as potential cell sources for tissue engineering and regeneration owing to its virtually unlimited replicative capacity and the potential to differentiate into a variety of cell types. Current differentiation strategies primarily involve various growth factor/inducer/repressor concoctions with less emphasis on the substrate. Developing biomaterials to promote stem cell proliferation and differentiation could aid in the realization of this goal. Extracellular matrix (ECM) components are important physiological regulators, and can provide cues to direct ESC expansion and differentiation. ECM undergoes constant remodeling with surrounding cells to accommodate specific developmental event. In this study, using ESC derived aggregates called embryoid bodies (EB) as a model, we characterized the biological nature of ECM in EB after exposure to different treatments: spontaneously differentiated and retinoic acid treated (denoted as SPT and RA, respectively). Next, we extracted this treatment-specific ECM by detergent decellularization methods (Triton X-100, DOC and SDS are compared). The resulting EB ECM scaffolds were seeded with undifferentiated ESCs using a novel cell seeding strategy, and the behavior of ESCs was studied. Our results showed that the optimized protocol efficiently removes cells while retaining crucial ECM and biochemical components. Decellularized ECM from SPT EB gave rise to a more favorable microenvironment for promoting ESC attachment, proliferation, and early differentiation, compared to native EB and decellularized ECM from RA EB. These findings suggest that various treatment conditions allow the formulation of unique ESC-ECM derived scaffolds to enhance ESC bioactivities, including proliferation and differentiation for tissue regeneration applications.",

        "abstract": "HUC-MSCs possess mature hepatocytes\u2019 specific markers and functions, which change gradually as they undergo cell senescence, and the hepatic differentiation efficiency of in vitro-aged hUC- MSCs decreased dramatically in the late passage (P8). Background Due to their multipotency and ability for self-renewal, human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) hold great promise for generating hepatocytes. Previous research has successfully generated hepatocytes from early-passage [i.e., passage (P)3] hUC-MSCs; however, the populations of early-passage cells are limited, and these cells cannot produce sufficient functional hepatocytes for large-scale application in clinical therapy. Thus, a thorough investigation of the hepatic differentiation potential of in vitro-aged hUC-MSCs is needed. Methods hUC-MSCs were passaged in vitro and subcultured every 3 days up to P8, and their morphology, proliferative capacity, liver-specific marker expression, and liver function at the end of each passage were analyzed. The efficiency of the hepatogenic differentiation of hUC-MSCs driven by a functional hit 1 (FH1)-based strategy at different passages was also evaluated. Results The in vitro-aged hUC-MSCs gradually displayed morphological inhomogeneity, had reduced proliferative capability, and exhibited senescent properties while maintaining adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential. Additionally, senescence also decreased the expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in albumin (ALB) and alpha 1-antitrpsin (A1AT) in these cells and their relative protein expression, which is the marker of a mature hepatocyte. The liver function of the in vitro-aged hUC-MSCs also deteriorated gradually. Finally, the percentage of hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) generated from in vitro-aged hUC-MSCs reduced significantly, and the mature hepatocyte functions, such as ALB secretion, glycogen synthesis, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) intake, and indocyanine green (ICG) uptake, also changed. Conclusions hUC-MSCs possess mature hepatocytes\u2019 specific markers and functions, which change gradually as they undergo cell senescence. Due to the loss of these properties within in vitro subcultures, the hepatic differentiation efficiency of in vitro-aged hUC-MSCs decreased dramatically in the late passage (P8). The current study provides valuable information can inform future research on liver disease.",

        "abstract": "It is summarized that SMAD2/3 regulates pluripotency and differentiation mainly through four aspects, controlling divergent transcriptional networks of pluripOTency and differentiate; interacting with chromatin modifiers to make the chromatin accessible or recruiting METTL3-METTL14-WTAP complex to promote differentiation. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) possess the potential of long-term self-renewal and three primary germ layers differentiation, and thus hESCs are expected to have broad applications in cell therapy, drug screening and basic research on human early embryonic development. Many efforts have been put to dissect the regulation of pluripotency and direct differentiation of hESCs. TGF\u03b2/Activin/Nodal signal pathway critically regulates pluripotency maintenance and cell differentiation through the main signal transducer SMAD2/3 in hESCs, but the action manners of SMAD2/3 in hESCs are sophisticated and not documented yet. Here we review and discuss the roles of SMAD2/3 in hESC pluripotency maintenance and differentiation initiation separately. We summarize that SMAD2/3 regulates pluripotency and differentiation mainly through four aspects, (1) controlling divergent transcriptional networks of pluripotency and differentiation; (2) interacting with chromatin modifiers to make the chromatin accessible or recruiting METTL3-METTL14-WTAP complex and depositing m6A to the mRNA of pluripotency genes; (3) acting as a transcription factor to activate endoderm-specific genes to thus initiate definitive endoderm differentiation, which happens as cyclin D/CDK4/6 downstream target in later G1 phase as well; (4) interacting with endoderm specific lncRNAs to promote differentiation.",

        "abstract": "Improvements in culture and gene editing technologies could soon enable transplants of laboratory-grown organoids, resolving the issue of donor shortages, and the suitability of cell replacement therapy to treat different types of liver diseases is discussed. Historically, primary hepatocytes have been difficult to expand or maintain in vitro. In this review, we will focus on recent advances in establishing hepatocyte organoids and their potential applications in regenerative medicine. First, we provide a background on the renewal of hepatocytes in the homeostatic as well as the injured liver. Next, we describe strategies for establishing primary hepatocyte organoids derived from either adult or fetal liver based on insights from signaling pathways regulating hepatocyte renewal in vivo. The characteristics of these organoids will be described herein. Notably, hepatocyte organoids can adopt either a proliferative or a metabolic state, depending on the culture conditions. Furthermore, the metabolic gene expression profile can be modulated based on the principles that govern liver zonation. Finally, we discuss the suitability of cell replacement therapy to treat different types of liver diseases and the current state of cell transplantation of in vitro-expanded hepatocytes in mouse models. In addition, we provide insights into how the regenerative microenvironment in the injured host liver may facilitate donor hepatocyte repopulation. In summary, transplantation of in vitro-expanded hepatocytes holds great potential for large-scale clinical application to treat liver diseases. Improved methods for growing organs from liver cells in the laboratory hold great potential for treating liver diseases through transplantation. Weng Chuan Peng and co-workers at the Princess M\u00e1xima Center for Pediatric Oncology in Utrecht, The Netherlands, have reviewed recent advances in growing and maintaining liver cells, or hepatocytes, in vitro so that they form organoids (miniature organs) suitable for cell replacement therapies. Researchers have used three-dimensional cultures to expand adult hepatocytes from healthy mouse livers and added the crucial inflammatory signaling molecule TNF-\u03b1 to mimic tissue repair processes. The resulting organoids showed extensive engraftment and repopulation in a mouse liver injury model. Challenges remain in culturing human hepatocytes, but recent breakthroughs in culture and gene editing technologies could soon enable transplants of laboratory-grown organoids, resolving the issue of donor shortages.",

        "abstract": "A single-cell RNA sequencing approach is used to characterise cellular heterogeneity within bovine muscle and muscle-derived cell cultures over time, and characterise dynamic subpopulations and transitions between active, quiescent, and committed states of SCs, and demonstrate methods for modulation of these states during long-term proliferative cultures. \u2018Cultured\u2019 meat technologies leverage the proliferation and differentiation of animal-derived stem cells ex vivo to produce edible tissues for human consumption in a sustainable fashion. However, skeletal muscle is a dynamic and highly complex tissue, involving the interplay of numerous mono- and multinucleated cells, including muscle fibres, satellite cells (SCs) and fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), and recreation of the tissue in vitro thus requires the characterisation and manipulation of a broad range of cell types. Here, we use a single-cell RNA sequencing approach to characterise cellular heterogeneity within bovine muscle and muscle-derived cell cultures over time. Using this data, we identify numerous distinct cell type, and develop robust protocols for the easy purification and proliferation of several of these populations. We note overgrowth of undesirable cell types within heterogeneous proliferative cultures as a barrier to efficient cultured meat production, and use transcriptomics to identify conditions that favour the growth of SCs in the context of serum-free medium. Combining RNA velocities computed in silico with time-resolved flow cytometric analysis, we characterise dynamic subpopulations and transitions between active, quiescent, and committed states of SCs, and demonstrate methods for modulation of these states during long-term proliferative cultures. This work provides an important reference for advancing our knowledge of bovine skeletal muscle biology, and its application in the development of cultured meat technologies.",

        "abstract": "It is hypothesized that culturing mouse embryonic stem cells under simulated microgravity conditions in rotary bioreactors (BRs) will enhance the induction of directed DE differentiation, and the advantage of dynamic cultures in BRs to specifically enhance directedDE differentiation is indicated. Directed in vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells towards definitive endoderm (DE) offers great research and therapeutic potential since these cells can further differentiate into cells of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as associated organs such as pancreas, liver, and thyroid. We hypothesized that culturing mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) under simulated microgravity (SMG) conditions in rotary bioreactors (BRs) will enhance the induction of directed DE differentiation. To test our hypothesis, we cultured the cells for 6 days in two dimensional (2D) monolayer colony cultures, or as embryoid bodies (EBs) in either static conditions or, dynamically, in the rotary BRs. We used flow cytometry and qPCR to analyze the expression of marker proteins and genes, respectively, for pluripotency (Oct3/4) and mesendodermal (Brachyury T), endodermal (FoxA2, Sox17, CxCr4), and mesodermal (Vimentin, Meox1) lineages. Culture in the form of EBs in maintenance media (MM) in the presence of LIF, in static or SMG conditions, induced expression of some of the differentiation markers, suggesting heterogeneity of the cells. This is in line with previous studies showing that differentiation is initiated as cells are aggregated into EBs even without supplementing differentiation factors to the media. Culturing EBs in static conditions in differentiation media (DM) in the presence of activin A, reduced Oct3/4 expression, and significantly increased Brachyury T and CxCr4 expression, but downregulated FoxA2 and Sox17. However, culturing in SMG BRs in DM upregulated Brachyury T and all of the DE markers, and reduced Oct3/4 expression, indicating the advantage of dynamic cultures in BRs to specifically enhance directed DE differentiation. Given the potential discrepancies between the SMG conditions on earth and actual microgravity conditions, as observed in other studies, future experiments in space flight are required to validate the effects of reduced gravity on mESCs differentiation.",

        "abstract": "Reversible and irreversible cryoinjury mechanisms that result in susceptibility to host T\u2010cell cytolysis and affect MSC's cell survival and tissue distribution are identified. We have previously demonstrated that cryopreservation and thawing lead to altered Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) functionalities. Here, we further analyzed MSC's fitness post freeze\u2010thaw. We have observed that thawed MSC can suppress T\u2010cell proliferation when separated from them by transwell membrane and the effect is lost in a MSC:T\u2010cell coculture system. Unlike actively growing MSCs, thawed MSCs were lysed upon coculture with activated autologous Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) and the lysing effect was further enhanced with allogeneic PBMCs. The use of DMSO\u2010free cryoprotectants or substitution of Human Serum Albumin (HSA) with human platelet lysate in freezing media and use of autophagy or caspase inhibitors did not prevent thaw defects. We tested the hypothesis that IFN\u03b3 prelicensing before cryobanking can enhance MSC fitness post thaw. Post thawing, IFN\u03b3 licensed MSCs inhibit T cell proliferation as well as fresh MSCs and this effect can be blocked by 1\u2010methyl Tryptophan, an Indoleamine 2,3\u2010dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor. In addition, IFN\u03b3 prelicensed thawed MSCs inhibit the degranulation of cytotoxic T cells while IFN\u03b3 unlicensed thawed MSCs failed to do so. However, IFN\u03b3 prelicensed thawed MSCs do not deploy lung tropism in vivo following intravenous injection as well as fresh MSCs suggesting that IFN\u03b3 prelicensing does not fully rescue thaw\u2010induced lung homing defect. We identified reversible and irreversible cryoinjury mechanisms that result in susceptibility to host T\u2010cell cytolysis and affect MSC's cell survival and tissue distribution. The susceptibility of MSC to negative effects of cryopreservation and the potential to mitigate the effects with IFN\u03b3 prelicensing may inform strategies to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of MSC in clinical use.

        "abstract": "CECs were shown to affect both biochemical test values and morphological parameters in rats with CLF and implantation of BMCG-derived CECs with allogeneic LCs and MMSC BM might represent a proper option to correct and treat CLF, as well as to maintain affected liver function in patients with liver grafting needed. Our study sought approaches for chronic liver failure (CLF) treatment and correction via cell-engineered constructs (CECs). They are built from biopolymer-based, microstructured, and collagen-containing hydrogel (BMCG). We also strove to evaluate the functional activity of BMCG in liver regeneration. Materials and Methods: Allogeneic liver cells (namely, hepatocytes; LC) together with mesenchymal multipotent stem cells of bone marrow origin (MMSC BM; BMSCs) were adhered to our BMCG to compose implanted liver CECs. Thereafter, we investigated a model of CLF in rats receiving the implanted CECs. The CLF had been provoked by long-term exposure to carbon tetrachloride. The study comprised male Wistar rats (n = 120) randomized into 3 groups: Group 1 was a control group with the saline treatment of the hepatic parenchyma (n = 40); Group 2 received BMCG only (n = 40); and Group 3 was loaded with CECs implanted into the parenchyma of their livers (n = 40). August rats (n = 30) made up a donor population for LCs and MMSC BM to develop grafts for animals from Group 3. The study length was 90 days. Results: CECs were shown to affect both biochemical test values and morphological parameters in rats with CLF. Conclusion: We found BMCG-derived CECs to be operational and active, with regenerative potential. Group 3 showed significant evidence of forced liver regeneration that tended to persist until the end of the study (day 90). The phenomenon is reflected by biochemical signs of hepatic functional recovery by day 30 after grafting (compared to Groups 1 and 2), whereas structural features of liver repair (necrosis prevention, missing formation of vacuoles, degenerating LC number decrease, and delay of hepatic fibrotic transformation). Such implantation of BMCG-derived CECs with allogeneic LCs and MMSC BM might represent a proper option to correct and treat CLF, as well as to maintain affected liver function in patients with liver grafting needed.",

        "abstract": "Continuous improvement to the quality of HLCs, deeper investigation of relevant biological processes, and proper adaptation of recent advances in cell culture platforms, genome editing technology, and bioengineering systems are required before H LCs can fulfill the needs in basic and translational research. Human hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) promise a valuable source of cells with human genetic background, physiologically relevant liver functions, and unlimited supply. With over 10 years\u2019 efforts in this field, great achievements have been made. HLCs have been successfully derived and applied in disease modeling, toxicity testing and drug discovery. Large cohorts of induced pluripotent stem cells-derived HLCs have been recently applied in studying population genetics and functional outputs of common genetic variants in vitro. This has offered a new paradigm for genome-wide association studies and possibly in vitro pharmacogenomics in the nearly future. However, HLCs have not yet been successfully applied in bioartificial liver devices and have only displayed limited success in cell transplantation. HLCs still have an immature hepatocyte phenotype and exist as a population with great heterogeneity, and HLCs derived from different hPSC lines display variable differentiation efficiency. Therefore, continuous improvement to the quality of HLCs, deeper investigation of relevant biological processes, and proper adaptation of recent advances in cell culture platforms, genome editing technology, and bioengineering systems are required before HLCs can fulfill the needs in basic and translational research. In this review, we summarize the discoveries, achievements, and challenges in the derivation and applications of HLCs.",

        "abstract": "A critical survey of existing literature on human and machine recognition of faces is presented, followed by a brief overview of the literature on face recognition in the psychophysics community and a detailed overview of move than 20 years of research done in the engineering community. The goal of this paper is to present a critical survey of existing literature on human and machine recognition of faces. Machine recognition of faces has several applications, ranging from static matching of controlled photographs as in mug shots matching and credit card verification to surveillance video images. Such applications have different constraints in terms of complexity of processing requirements and thus present a wide range of different technical challenges. Over the last 20 years researchers in psychophysics, neural sciences and engineering, image processing analysis and computer vision have investigated a number of issues related to face recognition by humans and machines. Ongoing research activities have been given a renewed emphasis over the last five years. Existing techniques and systems have been tested on different sets of images of varying complexities. But very little synergism exists between studies in psychophysics and the engineering literature. Most importantly, there exists no evaluation or benchmarking studies using large databases with the image quality that arises in commercial and law enforcement applications In this paper, we first present different applications of face recognition in commercial and law enforcement sectors. This is followed by a brief overview of the literature on face recognition in the psychophysics community. We then present a detailed overview of move than 20 years of research done in the engineering community. Techniques for segmentation/location of the face, feature extraction and recognition are reviewed. Global transform and feature based methods using statistical, structural and neural classifiers are summarized. >",

Apart from the paternal half of the genetic material, the male gamete carries assorted epigenetic marks for optimal fertilization and the developmental trajectory for the early embryo. Recent works showed dynamic changes in small noncoding RNA (sncRNA) in spermatozoa as they transit through the testicular environment to the epididymal segments. Studies demonstrated the changes to be mediated by epididymosomes during the transit through the adluminal duct in the epididymis, and the changes in sperm sncRNA content stemmed from environmental insults significantly altering the early embryo development and predisposing the offspring to metabolic disorders. Here, we review the current knowledge on the establishment of the sperm sncRNA transcriptome and their role in male-factor infertility, evidence of altered offspring health in response to the paternal life experiences through sperm sncRNA species and, finally, their implications in assisted reproductive technology in terms of epigenetic inheritance.",

        "abstract": "Different genes associated directly or indirectly with disease development and progression are discussed, including hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation in PCOS females. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine disorder affecting females in their reproductive age. The early diagnosis of PCOS is complicated and complex due to overlapping symptoms of this disease. The most accepted diagnostic approach today is the Rotterdam Consensus (2003), which supports the positive diagnosis of PCOS when patients present two out of the following three symptoms: biochemical and clinical signs of hyperandrogenism, oligo, and anovulation, also polycystic ovarian morphology on sonography. Genetic variance, epigenetic changes, and disturbed lifestyle lead to the development of pathophysiological disturbances, which include hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation in PCOS females. At the molecular level, different proteins and molecular and signaling pathways are involved in disease progression, which leads to the failure of a single genetic diagnostic approach. The genetic approach to elucidate the mechanism of pathogenesis of PCOS was recently developed, whereby four phenotypic variances of PCOS categorize PCOS patients into classic, ovulatory, and non-hyperandrogenic types. Genetic studies help to identify the root cause for the development of this PCOS. PCOS genetic inheritance is autosomal dominant but the latest investigations revealed it as a multigene origin disease. Different genetic loci and specific genes have been identified so far as being associated with this disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and related genetic studies have changed the scenario for the diagnosis and treatment of this reproductive and metabolic condition known as PCOS. This review article briefly discusses different genes associated directly or indirectly with disease development and progression.",

        "abstract": "In insight into the underlying mechanism controlling the reprogramming efficiency of miniature pig cells, the expression level of the switch/sucrose nonfermentable component BAF60A regulated by STAT3 signaling determined the efficiency of pig iPSC generation. Miniature pigs are an ideal animal model for translational research to evaluate stem cell therapies and regenerative applications. While the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from miniature pigs has been demonstrated, there is still a lack of a reliable method to generate and maintain miniature pig iPSCs. In this study, we derived iPSCs from fibroblasts of Wisconsin miniature swine (WMS), Yucatan miniature swine (YMS), and G\u00f6ttingen minipigs (GM) using our culture medium. By comparing cells of the different pig breeds, we found that YMS fibroblasts were more efficiently reprogrammed into iPSCs, forming colonies with well-defined borders, than WMS and GM fibroblasts. We also demonstrated that YMS iPSC lines with a normal pig karyotype gave rise to cells of the three germ layers in vitro and in vivo. Mesenchymal stromal cells expressing phenotypic characteristics were derived from established iPSC lines as an example of potential applications. In addition, we found that the expression level of the switch/sucrose nonfermentable component BAF60A regulated by STAT3 signaling determined the efficiency of pig iPSC generation. The findings of this study provide insight into the underlying mechanism controlling the reprogramming efficiency of miniature pig cells to develop a viable strategy to enhance the generation of iPSCs for biomedical research.",

        "abstract": "This work provides the first mechanistic explanation for DIS3L2-induced overgrowth in humans and flies and identifies an ancient proliferation pathway controlled by Dis3 L2 to regulate cell proliferation and tissue growth. Dis3L2 is a highly conserved 3\u2019-5\u2019 exoribonuclease which is mutated in the human overgrowth disorders Perlman syndrome and Wilms\u2019 tumour of the kidney. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system, we have generated a new dis3L2 null mutant together with wild-type and nuclease-dead genetic lines in Drosophila to demonstrate that the catalytic activity of Dis3L2 is required to control cell proliferation. To understand the cellular pathways regulated by Dis3L2 to control proliferation, we used RNA-seq on dis3L2 mutant wing discs to show that the imaginal disc growth factor Idgf2 is responsible for driving the wing overgrowth. IDGFs are conserved proteins homologous to human chitinase-like proteins such as CHI3L1/YKL-40 which are implicated in tissue regeneration as well as cancers including colon cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. We also demonstrate that loss of DIS3L2 in human kidney HEK-293T cells results in cell proliferation, illustrating the conservation of this important cell proliferation pathway. Using these human cells, we show that loss of DIS3L2 results in an increase in the PI3-Kinase/AKT signalling pathway, which we subsequently show to contribute towards the proliferation phenotype in Drosophila. Our work therefore provides the first mechanistic explanation for DIS3L2-induced overgrowth in humans and flies and identifies an ancient proliferation pathway controlled by Dis3L2 to regulate cell proliferation and tissue growth.",

        "abstract": "The future of the field of single-cell RNA-sequencing is discussed, with a particular focus on how to move beyond the currently employed snapshot measurements of cell states, in order to properly identify how the state of a cell affects its future behaviour. In complex organisms, each individual derives from a single fertilised ovum. This process of development is characterised by an increase in cell number and a diversification of the various cell types that are present. Development has been extensively studied not only to understand how cells commit to various lineages, but also with a view to reversing typical developmental pathways for regenerative medicine. However, studying development in vivo is challenging due to the very high degree of spatial complexity in an embryo, and the limited amount of biological material that is actually present in these systems. Recently developed single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies offer a powerful tool for studying development. They generate a rich phenotypic readout of a cell\u2019s state, providing gene-level information about what cells are doing, and allowing reconstruction of the molecular bases of developmental pathways at the appropriate scale for which developmental decisions are made. This Thesis begins with a summary of how single-cell RNA-sequencing data are generated and analysed, and how it has been used to study cell fate decision-making. The second chapter covers my work in identifying the extent of a technical confounder of high throughput sequencing experiments (barcode swapping), and how its consequences may be excluded from a subset of single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments where thousands of single cells are captured in microfluidic droplets for library preparation. I then detail the compilation of a large single-cell RNA-sequencing timecourse atlas of mouse development between embryonic days 6.5 and 8.5. I also performed analyses into the formation of the embryonic gut, which surprisingly receives contributions from extraembryonic tissue. The fourth and fifth chapters describe my investigation into the role of the genes Tal1 and T (also known as Brachyury) using chimaeric embryos. These genes are essential for proper development, and embryos die when they are entirely absent. Chimaeric embryos are composed of both knockout and wild-type cells: the wild-type cells contribute to the lineages that are compromised by the knockout, and the embryo remains healthy. The cell-intrinsic roles of these critical genes can therefore by studied in a proper in vivo context, unconfounded by the global abnormalities that would be induced by their absence from the whole embryo. Finally, I discuss the future of the field of single-cell RNA-sequencing, with a particular focus on how we can move beyond the currently employed snapshot measurements of cell states, in order to properly identify how the state of a cell affects its future behaviour.",

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been revealed to hold great potential for the development of new treatment approaches for various diseases. However, the clinical use of these cells is limited due to their tumorigenic effects. The therapeutic benefits of MSCs are largely dependent on paracrine factors including extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are nano\u2010sized bilayer membrane structures containing lipids, microRNAs and proteins which play key roles in cell\u2010to\u2010cell communications. Because of their lower immunogenicity, tumorigenicity, and easier management, EVs have emerged as a new promising alternative to whole\u2010cell therapy. Therefore, this paper reviews current preclinical studies on the use of EVs derived from human umbilical cord MSCs (hucMSCs) as a therapeutic approach in treatment of several diseases including neurological, cardiovascular, liver, kidney, and bone diseases as well as the cutaneous wound, inflammatory bowel disease, cancers, infertility, and other disorders.",

        "abstract": "In the present study, three experiments were designed to identify the most appropriate technique for freezing rabbit semen. Experiment 1 aimed to determine the optimal levels of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) contents in freezing medium and their effects on individual bucks. Semen ejaculates for each buck (n=15 bucks) were mixed and split into three portions for extension with a freezing medium containing varying concentrations of DMSO (0.75, 1.0, and 1.4 M). Diluted semen samples were packaged in 0.25 mL straws and suspended above liquid nitrogen (LN) for 10 min, then dipped in LN. A few days after freezing, post-thaw semen evaluation was assessed, and according to the results, six bucks and an extender containing 0.75 M of DMSO were used for experiments 2 and 3. In experiment 2, the pooled semen from 6 bucks was divided into two portions for packaging in two straw sizes (0.25 and 0.50 mL). Each straw size was divided into five groups and suspended at different heights above LN (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 cm) for 10 minutes before being preserved in LN. In experiment 3, the pooled semen was divided into four portions for dilution with freezing medium containing different concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA; 0, 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 mg/mL). Semen samples were packaged in a 0.50 mL straw and suspended 10 min, 4 cm above LN for freezing. Pre-freezing and post-thawing, semen samples were evaluated for semen quality. Results showed that the extender containing 0.75 M DMSO had higher significant values for post-thaw sperm motility, longevity, acrosome integrity and sperm plasma membrane permeability. Bucks\u2019 individuality had significant effects on post-thaw motility, acrosome and sperm plasma membrane integrity. A significant interaction was recorded between DMSO concentrations and bucks\u2019 individuality on sperm longevity. Semen package sizes had no significant effects on the evaluated parameters. Semen was frozen at 2 and 4 cm above LN had significantly better post-thaw quality. BSA at concentrations 5 and 7.5 mg/mL improved recovery rates of acrosome integrity and sperm membrane permeability. DMSO 0.75 M and freezing 4 cm above LN seem to be more adequate for rabbit semen cryopreservation. The appropriate level of DMSO differs between bucks, as the post-thaw sperm longevity is affected. BSA enhanced acrosome and sperm membrane integrity. Results obtained will need further investigation to be confirmed in the field.",

        "title": "In Silico Analysis to Explore Lineage-Independent and -Dependent Transcriptional Programs Associated with the Process of Endothelial and Neural Differentiation of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells",
        "abstract": "It is proposed that genes that are similarly altered in both lineages participate in priming the stem cell for differentiation in a lineage-independent manner, whereas those that are differentially altered in endothelial compared to neural cells participate in a Lineage-specific differentiation process. Despite a major interest in understanding how the endothelial cell phenotype is established, the underlying molecular basis of this process is not yet fully understood. We have previously reported the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) from human umbilical vein endothelial cells and differentiation of the resulting HiPS back to endothelial cells (Ec-Diff), as well as neural (Nn-Diff) cell lineage that contained both neurons and astrocytes. Furthermore, the identities of these cell lineages were established by gene array analysis. Here, we explored the same arrays to gain insight into the gene alteration processes that accompany the establishment of endothelial vs. non-endothelial neural cell phenotypes. We compared the expression of genes that code for transcription factors and epigenetic regulators when HiPS is differentiated into these endothelial and non-endothelial lineages. Our in silico analyses have identified cohorts of genes that are similarly up- or downregulated in both lineages, as well as those that exhibit lineage-specific alterations. Based on these results, we propose that genes that are similarly altered in both lineages participate in priming the stem cell for differentiation in a lineage-independent manner, whereas those that are differentially altered in endothelial compared to neural cells participate in a lineage-specific differentiation process. Specific GATA family members and their cofactors and epigenetic regulators (DNMT3B, PRDM14, HELLS) with a major role in regulating DNA methylation were among participants in priming HiPS for lineage-independent differentiation. In addition, we identified distinct cohorts of transcription factors and epigenetic regulators whose alterations correlated specifically with the establishment of endothelial vs. non-endothelial neural lineages.",

        "abstract": "The use of newer biomaterials as scaffolds for efficient culture of primary hepatocytes and the derivation of mature hepatocytes from other cellular sources such as induced pluripotent stem cells, bone marrow stem cells and 3D liver organoids are described. Hepatocytes are differentiated cells that account for 80% of the hepatic volume and perform all major functions of the liver. In vivo, after an acute insult, adult hepatocytes retain their ability to proliferate and participate in liver regeneration. However, in vitro, prolonged culture and proliferation of viable and functional primary hepatocytes have remained the major and the most challenging goal of hepatocyte-based cell therapies and liver tissue engineering. The first functional cultures of rat primary hepatocytes between two layers of collagen gel, also termed as the \u201csandwich cultures\u201d, were reported in 1989. Since this study, several technical developments including choice of hydrogels, type of microenvironment, growth factors and culture conditions, mono or co-cultures of hepatocytes along with other supporting cell types have evolved for both rat and human primary hepatocytes in recent years. All these improvements have led to a substantial improvement in the number, life-span and hepatic functions of these cells in vitro for several downstream applications. In the current review, we highlight the details, limitations and prospects of different technical strategies being used in primary hepatocyte cultures. We discuss the use of newer biomaterials as scaffolds for efficient culture of primary hepatocytes. We also describe the derivation of mature hepatocytes from other cellular sources such as induced pluripotent stem cells, bone marrow stem cells and 3D liver organoids. Finally, we also explain the use of perfusion-based bioreactor systems and bioengineering strategies to support the long-term function of hepatocytes in 3D conditions.",

Cultured meat is an emergent technology with the potential for significant environmental and animal welfare benefits. Accurate mimicry of traditional meat requires fat tissue; a key contributor to both the flavour and texture of meat. Here, we show that fibro-adipogenic progenitor cells (FAPs) are present in bovine muscle, and are transcriptionally and immunophenotypically distinct from satellite cells. These two cell types can be purified from a single muscle sample using a simple fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) strategy. FAPs demonstrate high levels of adipogenic potential, as measured by gene expression changes and lipid accumulation, and can be proliferated for a large number of population doublings, demonstrating their suitability for a scalable cultured meat production process. Crucially, FAPs reach a mature level of adipogenic differentiation in three-dimensional, edible hydrogels. The resultant tissue accurately mimics traditional beef fat in terms of lipid profile and taste, and FAPs thus represent a promising candidate cell type for the production of cultured fat.",

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a physiological program that is activated during cancer cell invasion and metastasis. We show here that EMT-related processes are linked to a broad and conserved program of transcriptional alterations that are influenced by cell contact and adhesion. Using cultured human breast cancer and mouse mammary epithelial cells, we find that reduced cell density, conditions under which cell contact is reduced, leads to reduced expression of genes associated with mammary epithelial cell differentiation and increased expression of genes associated with breast cancer. We further find that treatment of cells with matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), an inducer of EMT, interrupts a defined subset of cell contact-regulated genes, including genes encoding a variety of RNA splicing proteins known to regulate the expression of Rac1b, an activated splice isoform of Rac1 known to be a key mediator of MMP-3-induced EMT in breast, lung, and pancreas. These results provide new insights into how MMPs act in cancer progression and how loss of cell-cell interactions is a key step in the earliest stages of cancer development.",

        "title": "Response of Pluripotent Stem Cells to Environmental Stress and Its Application for Directed Differentiation",
        "abstract": "The response to environmental stresses in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and their applications in the differentiation methods directed to specific lineages are summarized and the development of a stress-mediated differentiation protocol is important for the future. Simple Summary Environmental changes in oxygen concentration, temperature, and mechanical stimulation lead to the activation of specific transcriptional factors and induce the expression of each downstream gene. In general, these responses are protective machinery against such environmental stresses, while these transcriptional factors also regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and organ development in mammals. In the case of pluripotent stem cells, similar response mechanisms normally work and sometimes stimulate the differentiation cues. Up to now, differentiation protocols utilizing such environmental stresses have been reported to obtain various types of somatic cells from pluripotent stem cells. Basically, environmental stresses as hypoxia (low oxygen), hyperoxia, (high oxygen) and mechanical stress from cell culture plates are relatively safer than chemicals and gene transfers, which affect the genome irreversibly. Therefore, protocols designed with such environments in mind could be useful for the technology development of cell therapy and regenerative medicine. In this manuscript, we summarize recent findings of environmental stress-induced differentiation protocols and discuss their mechanisms. Abstract Pluripotent stem cells have unique characteristics compared to somatic cells. In this review, we summarize the response to environmental stresses (hypoxic, oxidative, thermal, and mechanical stresses) in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and their applications in the differentiation methods directed to specific lineages. Those stresses lead to activation of each specific transcription factor followed by the induction of downstream genes, and one of them regulates lineage specification. In short, hypoxic stress promotes the differentiation of ESCs to mesodermal lineages via HIF-1\u03b1 activation. Concerning mechanical stress, high stiffness tends to promote mesodermal differentiation, while low stiffness promotes ectodermal differentiation via the modulation of YAP1. Furthermore, each step in the same lineage differentiation favors each appropriate stiffness of culture plate; for example, definitive endoderm favors high stiffness, while pancreatic progenitor favors low stiffness during pancreatic differentiation of human ESCs. Overall, treatments utilizing those stresses have no genotoxic or carcinogenic effects except oxidative stress; therefore, the differentiated cells are safe and could be useful for cell replacement therapy. In particular, the effect of mechanical stress on differentiation is becoming attractive for the field of regenerative medicine. Therefore, the development of a stress-mediated differentiation protocol is an important matter for the future.",

Freshly thawed mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) transiently display altered cell physiology and a recent report by Chinnadurai et al. [Stem Cells 2016;34:2429\u20132442] demonstrated that thawed allogeneic MSCs are also susceptible to T\u2010cell mediated lysis in vitro and that this effect can be mitigated by activating MSCs with IFN\u2010\u03b3 prior to freeze and thaw.

        "abstract": "The effective correction of chronic liver failure can be carried out by using the implanted liver CECs, in which donor liver cells and MMSC BM where presented in ratios \u2013 1 : 1; 5 : 1 and 10 : 1. Aim:to determinate the most effective liver cells and multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells of bone marrow (MMSC BM) ratio into implantable cell engineering constructions (CECs) used for chronic liver failure (CLF) correcting.Materials and methods.For creating liver CECs it was used a biopolymer implant \u2013 a composition of a heterogeneous collagen-containing gel (BMCG) (Sphero\u00aeGEL trademark) containing viable liver cells and MMSC BM in the following ratios \u2013 1 : 1; 5 : 1 and 10 : 1 respectively. CECs with different ratios of liver cells and MMSC BM were implanted into liver of rats in which chronic liver failure (CLF), was modeled by using CCl4. The effectiveness of the regulatory effects of CECs (with different cell ratios) on regenerative processes in livers were assessed by using biochemical, morphological and morphometric methods at different periods after their implantation.Results.Corrective effect of CECs with different cell composition on biochemical and morphological parameters of livers at chronic liver failure was established. During studying the liver CECs with various cell ratios of liver cells and MMSC BM (1 : 1; 5 : 1 and 10 : 1 respectively), it was found that the most optimal ratio of cells into the CECs is 5 : 1, because at this ratio of cells, there were a more distinct normalization of the morphological and functional liver parameters within 365 days after modeling CLF and maintenance of the structural homeostasis into the CECs. Themselves, which allows predicting their long-term regulatory effect on the liver tissue in CLF and maintaining its normal structural and functional state.Conclusion.The effective correction of chronic liver failure can be carried out by using the implanted liver CECs, in which donor liver cells and MMSC BM where presented in ratios \u2013 1 : 1; 5 : 1 and 10 : 1. But analysis of prolonged correction of liver morphological and functional parameters at CECs using it was allow to recommend the preferences using of CECs with ratio 5 : 1, because prolonged preservation of structural homeostasis into these CECs makes possible to prognosticate their prolonged regulatory action on the liver tissue at CLF, especially for recipients on a waiting list for liver transplantation.",

        "abstract": "Various methods have been developed to promote the maturation of HLCs, including chemical approaches, alteration of cell culture systems, and genetic manipulation, to meet the needs of in vivo transplantation and in vitro model establishment. Limited by the poor proliferation and restricted sources of adult hepatocytes, there is an urgent need to find substitutes for proliferation and cultivation of mature hepatocytes in vitro for use in disease treatment, drug approval, and toxicity testing. Hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs), which originate from undifferentiated stem cells or modified adult cells, are considered good candidates because of their advantages in terms of cell source and in vitro expansion ability. However, the majority of induced HLCs are in an immature state, and their degree of differentiation is heterogeneous, diminishing their usability in basic research and limiting their clinical application. Therefore, various methods have been developed to promote the maturation of HLCs, including chemical approaches, alteration of cell culture systems, and genetic manipulation, to meet the needs of in vivo transplantation and in vitro model establishment. This review proposes different cell types for the induction of HLCs, and provide a comprehensive overview of various techniques to promote the generation and maturation of HLCs in vitro.",

Face recognition presents a challenging problem in the field of image analysis and computer vision, and as such has received a great deal of attention over the last few years because of its many applications in various domains. Face recognition techniques can be broadly divided into three categories based on the face data acquisition methodology: methods that operate on intensity images; those that deal with video sequences; and those that require other sensory data such as 3D information or infra-red imagery. In this paper, an overview of some of the well-known methods in each of these categories is provided and some of the benefits and drawbacks of the schemes mentioned therein are examined. Furthermore, a discussion outlining the incentive for using face recognition, the applications of this technology, and some of the difficulties plaguing current systems with regard to this task has also been provided. This paper also mentions some of the most recent algorithms developed for this purpose and attempts to give an idea of the state of the art of face recognition technology.",

        "abstract": "In a paternal mouse model given a high-fat diet, a subset of sperm transfer RNA\u2013derived small RNAs (tsRNAs), mainly from 5\u2032 transfer RNA halves and ranging in size from 30 to 34 nucleotides, exhibited changes in expression profiles and RNA modifications. Offspring affected by sperm small RNAs Paternal dietary conditions in mammals influence the metabolic phenotypes of offspring. Although prior work suggests the involvement of epigenetic pathways, the mechanisms remains unclear. Two studies now show that altered paternal diet affects the level of small RNAs in mouse sperm. Chen et al. injected sperm transfer RNA (tRNA) fragments from males that had been kept on a high-fat diet into normal oocytes. The progeny displayed metabolic disorders and concomitant alteration of genes in metabolic pathways. Sharma et al. observed the biogenesis and function of small tRNA-derived fragments during sperm maturation. Further understanding of the mechanisms by which progeny are affected by parental exposure may affect human diseases such as diet-induced metabolic disorders. Science, this issue p. 397, p. 391 Fragments of transfer RNA in sperm serve as paternal epigenetic factors linked to diet-induced metabolic problems in their offspring. Increasing evidence indicates that metabolic disorders in offspring can result from the father\u2019s diet, but the mechanism remains unclear. In a paternal mouse model given a high-fat diet (HFD), we showed that a subset of sperm transfer RNA\u2013derived small RNAs (tsRNAs), mainly from 5\u2032 transfer RNA halves and ranging in size from 30 to 34 nucleotides, exhibited changes in expression profiles and RNA modifications. Injection of sperm tsRNA fractions from HFD males into normal zygotes generated metabolic disorders in the F1 offspring and altered gene expression of metabolic pathways in early embryos and islets of F1 offspring, which was unrelated to DNA methylation at CpG-enriched regions. Hence, sperm tsRNAs represent a paternal epigenetic factor that may mediate intergenerational inheritance of diet-induced metabolic disorders.",

        "abstract": "The pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnostic challenges in females with PCOS are focused on and artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning, is being introduced as a promising diagnostic and predictive tool for PCOS with minimal to zero error. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex and heterogeneous disorder that commonly affects women in the reproductive age group. The disorder has features that propose a blend of functional reproductive disorders, such as anovulation and hyperandrogenism, and metabolic disorders, such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, and obesity in women. Until today, the three implemented groups of criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS are from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the 1990s, Rotterdam 2003, and the Androgen Excess Polycystic Ovary Syndrome 2009 criteria. Currently, the most widely utilized criteria are the 2003 Rotterdam criteria, which validate the diagnosis of PCOS with the incidence of two out of the three criteria: hyperandrogenism (clinical and/or biochemical), irregular cycles, and polycystic ovary morphology. Currently, the anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone in serum is introduced as a substitute for the follicular count and is controversially emerging as an official polycystic ovarian morphology/PCOS marker. In adolescents, the two crucial factors for PCOS diagnosis are hyperandrogenism and irregular cycles. Recently, artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning, is being introduced as a promising diagnostic and predictive tool for PCOS with minimal to zero error that would help in clinical decisions regarding early management and treatment. Throughout this review, we focused on the pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnostic challenges in females with PCOS.",

Stem cells exist in vitro in a spectrum of interconvertible pluripotent cell states. Understanding the genetic and epigenetic regulatory processes underlying cell state transitions between these pluripotency states will have broad applications. Here, we applied a machine learning algorithm to analyze RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data derived from hundreds of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) resulting in the discovery of 24 gene network modules (GNMs) and 20 regulatory network modules (RNMs). Characterization of the network modules revealed that the GNMs and RNMs were highly correlated with each other and enabled us to decipher the roles that individual modules play in pluripotency and self-renewal. Genetic analyses identified regulatory variants that disrupted transcription factor binding and were associated with both decreased co-accessibility of regulatory elements within an RNM and increased stability of a particular pluripotency state. Our findings uncover novel pluripotency regulatory mechanisms and provide a rich resource for future stem cell research.",

        "abstract": "The successful generation of pluripotent stem cells from fibroblasts isolated from the Tibetan miniature pig using a modified iPS protocol more closely resemble human ESC than cells from other species is reported. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) technology appears to be a general strategy to generate pluripotent stem cells from any given mammalian species. So far, iPS cells have been reported for mouse, human, rat, and monkey. These four species have also established embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines that serve as the gold standard for pluripotency comparisons. Attempts have been made to generate porcine ESC by various means without success. Here we report the successful generation of pluripotent stem cells from fibroblasts isolated from the Tibetan miniature pig using a modified iPS protocol. The resulting iPS cell lines more closely resemble human ESC than cells from other species, have normal karyotype, stain positive for alkaline phosphatase, express high levels of ESC-like markers (Nanog, Rex1, Lin28, and SSEA4), and can differentiate into teratomas composed of the three germ layers. Because porcine physiology closely resembles human, the iPS cells reported here provide an attractive model to study certain human diseases or assess therapeutic applications of iPS in a large animal model.",

        "abstract": "Reduced levels of XRN1 are confirmed in osteosarcoma cell lines and patient samples and 134 transcripts show characteristics of direct post-transcriptional regulation by X RN1, suggesting thatXRN1 normally plays an important role in controlling lncRNA expression in these cells. XRN1 is a highly conserved exoribonuclease which degrades uncapped RNAs in a 5\u2019-3\u2019 direction. Degradation of RNAs by XRN1 is important in many cellular and developmental processes and is relevant to human disease. Studies in D. melanogaster demonstrate that XRN1 can target specific RNAs, which have important consequences for developmental pathways. Osteosarcoma is a malignancy of the bone and accounts for 2% of all paediatric cancers worldwide. 5 year survival of patients has remained static since the 1970s and therefore furthering our molecular understanding of this disease is crucial. Previous work has shown a downregulation of XRN1 in osteosarcoma cells, however the transcripts regulated by XRN1 which might promote osteosarcoma remain elusive. Here, we confirm reduced levels of XRN1 in osteosarcoma cell lines and patient samples and identify XRN1-sensitive transcripts in human osteosarcoma cells. Using RNA-seq in XRN1-knockdown SAOS-2 cells, we show that 1178 genes are differentially regulated. Using a novel bioinformatic approach, we demonstrate that 134 transcripts show characteristics of direct post-transcriptional regulation by XRN1. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are enriched in this group suggesting that XRN1 normally plays an important role in controlling lncRNA expression in these cells. Among potential lncRNAs targeted by XRN1 is HOTAIR, which is known to be upregulated in osteosarcoma and contribute to disease progression. We have also identified G-rich and GU motifs in post-transcriptionally regulated transcripts which appear to sensitise them to XRN1 degradation. Our results therefore provide significant insights into the specificity of XRN1 in human cells which is relevant to disease.",

        "abstract": "It is reported that miR-17-92 directly recruits to 3\u2019UTR of Cdt2 and downregulates this oncogene which suppresses the proliferation, migration, invasion capabilities of the CC cell lines while normal cells are fine. Cervical cancer (CC) is 4th largest killer of women worldwide when diagnosed in late stages the treatment options are almost negligible. 99% of CC is caused by high risk human papilloma viruses (HR-HPV). Upon integration into human genome the encoded viral proteins mis-regulates various onco-suppressor and checkpoint factors including cell cycle regulators. One such factor is cell cycle S phase licensing factor Cdt2, which has been reported to be highly upregulated in various cancers including CC. HPV proteins also suppress several tumor suppressor miRNAs concluding miR-17-92 cluster. In this study we report that miR-17-92 directly recruits to 3\u2019UTR of Cdt2 and downregulates this oncogene which suppresses the proliferation, migration, invasion capabilities of the CC cell lines while normal cells are fine. Suppression of Cdt2 by miR17-92 blocks the cancerous cells in S phase and induces apoptosis eventually leading to their death. Hence, our work for the first time mechanistically shows how miR17-92 could work as tumor suppressor opening up the potential of miR17-92 to be used in developing therapy for cervical cancer treatment.",

        "abstract": "Investigation of the role of HDACi, valproic acid (VPA) and DNMTi,5-azacytidine (5-aza) along with a hepatic inducer in the hepatic differentiation of hUC-MSCs showed that the pretreatment of epigenetic modifiers not only increased the hepatics genes but also increased the expression of the hepatatic proteins. Human umbilical cord (hUC) derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be progressively differentiated into multiple lineages including hepatic lineages, and thus provide an excellent in vitro model system for the study of hepatic differentiation. At present, hepatic differentiation protocols are based on the use of soluble chemicals in the culture medium and provide immature hepatic like cells. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) are two important epigenetic modifiers that regulate stem cell differentiation. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the role of HDACi, valproic acid (VPA) and DNMTi,5-azacytidine (5-aza) along with a hepatic inducer in the hepatic differentiation of hUC-MSCs. hUC-MSCs were characterized via immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. The final concentrations of VPA and 5-aza were optimized via MTT cytotoxicity assay. All treated groups were assessed for the presence of hepatic genes and proteins through qPCR and immunocytochemistry, respectively. The results showed that the pretreatment of epigenetic modifiers not only increased the hepatic genes but also increased the expression of the hepatic proteins. VPA induces hepatic differentiation in hUC-MSCs with significant gene expression of hepatic markers i.e., FOXA2 and CK8. Moreover, VPA pretreatment enhanced the expression of hepatic proteins AFP and TAT. The pretreatment of 5-aza shows significant gene expression of hepatic marker LDL-R. However, 5-aza treatment failed to induce hepatic protein expression. The results of the current study highlighted the effectiveness of epigenetic modifiers in the hepatic differentiation of hUC-MSCs. These differentiated cells can be employed in cell-based therapeutics for hepatic diseases in future.",

        "abstract": "This work systematically examined how gene expression and DNA methylation programs change at temporal developmental stages during cardiogenesis and identified four novel cardiac-related transcription factors, i.e., SORBS2, MITF, DPF3, and ZNF436, which have no or few prior literature reports and can be easily implemented in other stem cell-based systems. ABSTRACT Stem cell-based cardiogenesis has become a powerful tool to enhance our understanding of cardiac development and test novel therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases. However, transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of multiple transitional stages from pluripotent cells to committed cardiomyocytes has not yet been fully characterized. To characterize how transcription factors, lincRNAs and DNA methylation change at temporal developmental stages, and identify potential novel regulators during cardiogenesis. We utilized a previously reported protocol that yields human cardiomyocytes (hCM) with more than 90% purity from human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESC). Leveraging the purity of cells resulting from this protocol, we systematically examined how gene expression and DNA methylation programs change at temporal developmental stages during cardiogenesis. Our results provide a comprehensive view of expression changes during cardiogenesis that extend previous studies, allowing us to identify key transcription factors as well as lincRNAs that are strongly associated with cardiac differentiation. Moreover, we incorporated a simple but powerful method to screen for novel regulators of cardiogenesis solely based on expression changes and found four novel cardiac-related transcription factors, i.e., SORBS2, MITF, DPF3, and ZNF436, which have no or few prior literature reports and we were able to validate using siRNA. Our strategy of identifying novel regulators of cardiogenesis can also be easily implemented in other stem cell-based systems. Our results provide a valuable resource for understanding cardiogenesis that extends previous findings by leveraging the purity of our cell lines, which allowed us to identify four novel cardiac-related regulators.",

        "abstract": "Changes in morphology and enhancement of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) activity by glucagon were used to determine the differentiated status of hepatocytes in 2d-short-term culture. Primary hepatocytes lose their differentiated functions rapidly when in culture. Our aim was to maintain the differentiated status of hepatocytes in vitro by means of vital hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), their soluble and particulate factors and lipid extracts. Hepatocytes were placed into collagen-coated culture dishes in the presence of HSCs at different ages of pre-culture, with or without direct cell to cell contacts, at different cell ratios and in monoculture with cellular HSC components in place of vital cells. Changes in morphology and enhancement of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) activity by glucagon were used to determine the differentiated status of hepatocytes in 2d-short-term culture. HSCs proved able to maintain the differentiated function of hepatocytes in co-culture either by direct cell contacts or via factors derived from HSC-conditioned medium. In comparison, however, without cellular contact to hepatocytes five to ten times as many HSCs were necessary to increase the PCK activity to the same degree as in the presence of intercellular contacts. Whereas stimulation in the presence of HSC/hepatocyte contacts was independent of HSC culture age only quiescent, resting HSCs (precultured for 1\u20132\u00a0d) were able to stimulate hepatocytes significantly via soluble factors. Culturing of hepatocytes with a lipid extract or a particulate fraction from HSCs clearly displayed a very strong beneficial effect on enzyme activity and morphology. HSCs maintain hepatocyte function and structure through preferentially cell-bound signalling and transfer of lipids.",

        "abstract": "The merit of TMSCs as a therapeutic agent that retains favorable MSCs properties until relatively late passages is found and it is revealed that pre-treatment of TNF-\u03b1 can enhance the immunomodulatory abilities of T MSCs through the upregulation of the PTGS2/PGE2 axis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been spotlighted in the field of cell therapies as a promising tool for the treatment of intractable inflammatory diseases. However, their therapeutic potency still shows a gap between preclinical and clinical settings, and distinctive characteristics of specific tissue-derived MSCs and definitive ways to maximize their beneficial functions have not been fully elucidated yet. We previously identified the unique MSCs population from human palatine tonsil (TMSCs) and revealed their superior properties in proliferation and ROS regulation. Based on these findings, we explored further characteristics of TMSCs particularly focused on immunomodulatory function. We found the merit of TMSCs as a therapeutic agent that retains favorable MSCs properties until relatively late passages and revealed that pre-treatment of TNF-\u03b1 can enhance the immunomodulatory abilities of TMSCs through the upregulation of the PTGS2/PGE2 axis. TMSCs primed with TNF-\u03b1 effectively restrained the proliferation and differentiation of T lymphocytes and macrophages in vitro, and more interestingly, these TNF-\u03b1-licensed TMSCs exhibited significant prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in a murine model of autoimmune-mediated acute colitis via clinical and histopathological assessment compared to unprimed na\u00efve TMSCs. These findings provide novel insight into the optimization and standardization of MSCs-based anti-inflammatory therapies, especially targeting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).",

Aim: In this study, we seek to check if recombinant spidroin rS1/9 is applicable for cell-engineering construct development. Novel technologies of cell and tissue engineering are relevant for chronic liver failure management. Liver regeneration may represent one of the possible treatment options if a cell-engineered construct (CEC) is used. Nowadays, one can see the continuous study of various matrices to create an appropriate CEC. Materials and Methods: We have adhered allogenic liver cells and multipotent mesenchymal bone marrow stem cells (MMSC BM) to a microgel with recombinant spidroin rS1/9. Then we have studied the developed implantable CEC in a rat model (n = 80) of chronic liver failure achieved by prolonged poisoning with carbon tetrachloride. Results: Our results demonstrate that the CECs change the values of biochemical tests and morphological parameters in chronic liver failure in rats. Conclusion: We consider there to be a positive effect from the microgel-based CECs with recombinant spidroin rS1/9 in the treatment of chronic liver failure.",

        "abstract": "The results may provide a molecular basis for the differences observed between the two differentiation methods and suggest ways to further improve hepatocyte differentiation in order to obtain more mature HLCs for biomedical applications. Directed differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into hepatocytes could provide an unlimited source of liver cells, and therefore holds great promise for regenerative medicine, disease modeling, drug screening and toxicology studies. Various methods have been established during the past decade to differentiate human iPSCs into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) using growth factors and/or small molecules. However, direct comparison of the differentiation efficiency and the quality of the final HLCs between different methods has rarely been reported. In the current study, two hepatocyte differentiation methods were devised, termed Method 1 and 2, through modifying existing well-known hepatocyte differentiation strategies, and the resultant cells were compared phenotypically and functionally at different stages of hepatocyte differentiation. Compared to Method 1, higher differentiation efficiency and reproducibility were observed in Method 2, which generated highly homogeneous functional HLCs at the end of the differentiation process. The cells exhibited morphology closely resembling primary human hepatocytes and expressed high levels of hepatic protein markers. More importantly, these HLCs demonstrated several essential characteristics of mature hepatocytes, including major serum protein (albumin, fibronectin and \u03b1-1 antitrypsin) secretion, urea release, glycogen storage and inducible cytochrome P450 activity. Further transcriptomic comparison of the HLCs derived from the two methods identified 1,481 differentially expressed genes (DEGs); 290 Gene Ontology terms in the biological process category were enriched by these genes, which were further categorized into 34 functional classes. Pathway analysis of the DEGs identified several signaling pathways closely involved in hepatocyte differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, including \u2018signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells\u2019, \u2018Wnt signaling pathway\u2019, \u2018TGF-beta signaling pathway\u2019 and \u2018PI3K-Akt signaling pathway\u2019. These results may provide a molecular basis for the differences observed between the two differentiation methods and suggest ways to further improve hepatocyte differentiation in order to obtain more mature HLCs for biomedical applications.",

Face recognition has been challenging and interesting area in real time applications. Face recognition is a form of biometric identification that relies on data acquired from the face of an individual. A large number of face recognition along with their modifications, have been developed during the past decades. Face recognition presents a challenging problem in the field of image analysis and computer vision, and as such has received a great deal of attention over the last few years because of its many applications in various domains. In real world applications, it is desirable to have a stand-alone, embedded facerecognition system. The reason is that such systems provide a higher level of robustness,hardware optimization, and ease of integration. In this paper an attempt is made to review a wide range of methods used for face recognition comprehensively. This include PCA, ICA, LDA, SVM, Gabor wavelet soft computing tool like ANN for recognition, LBP and various hybrid combination of this techniques. This review investigates all these methods with parameters that challenges face recognition like pose variation, facial expressions and illuminations.",

Many findings support the hypothesis that metabolic changes associated with environmental factors can be transmitted from father to offspring. The molecular mechanisms underlying the intergenerational transmission of metabolic changes remain to be fully explored. These acquired metabolic disorders in offspring may be partially explained by some potential epigenetic information carriers such as DNA methylation, histone modification and small non-coding RNAs. Recent evidence shows that sperm tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) as a type of paternal epigenetic information carrier may mediate intergenerational inheritance. In this review, we provide current knowledge of a father's influence on metabolic disorders in subsequent generations and discuss the roles of sperm tsRNAs and their modifications in paternal epigenetic information transmission.",

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine and metabolic disorders in premenopausal women. Heterogeneous by nature, PCOS is defined by a combination of signs and symptoms of androgen excess and ovarian dysfunction in the absence of other specific diagnoses. The aetiology of this syndrome remains largely unknown, but mounting evidence suggests that PCOS might be a complex multigenic disorder with strong epigenetic and environmental influences, including diet and lifestyle factors. PCOS is frequently associated with abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic disorders and cardiovascular risk factors. The diagnosis and treatment of PCOS are not complicated, requiring only the judicious application of a few well-standardized diagnostic methods and appropriate therapeutic approaches addressing hyperandrogenism, the consequences of ovarian dysfunction and the associated metabolic disorders. This article aims to provide a balanced review of the latest advances and current limitations in our knowledge about PCOS while also providing a few clear and simple principles, based on current evidence-based clinical guidelines, for the proper diagnosis and long-term clinical management of women with PCOS.",

        "abstract": "The derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from pig fibroblasts is described by means of retroviral transduction of the same four reprogramming genes, OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC, used by others to create iPSCs from mouse and human somatic cells. Successful establishment of pluripotent embryonic stem cells from ungulates, especially pigs, is an important but challenging endeavor. The pig is an attractive species for creating pluripotent cell lines because, unlike the currently preferred mouse model, the pig resembles the human quite closely in size, anatomy, and physiology. This chapter describes the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from pig fibroblasts by means of retroviral transduction of the same four reprogramming genes, OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC, used by others to create iPSCs from mouse and human somatic cells. Besides describing technical aspects of porcine iPSC (piPSC) generation, which includes (1) virus preparation and transduction of porcine fibroblasts, (2) selection of reprogrammed cells and their properties, and (3) transcriptome profile of the cells, we discuss the extent to which our cells resemble and differ from the piPSCs generated by other groups. The piPSCs afford advantages in developing clinical models for human regenerative medicine and for testing the safety and efficacy of \u201cpersonalized\u201d transplants, and they may also have application in agriculture.",

        "abstract": "The expression of HOTAIR was significantly upregulated in OS tissues compared to matched adjacent normal tissues, using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and the results indicated that siR-HOTAIR may be a potential OS therapy. It has been proven that long non-coding (lnc)RNAs serve an important role in the tumorigenesis and development of several types of human malignancy. Previous studies have demonstrated that the lncRNA Hox transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) is involved in the development various types of cancer, including osteosarcoma (OS). However, the underlying mechanisms by which it has an affect are still largely unknown. In the present study, it was observed that the expression of HOTAIR was significantly upregulated in OS tissues compared to matched adjacent normal tissues, using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. HOTAIR was silenced using specific small interfering RNA (siRNA/siR), siR-HOTAIR, in order to investigate its role in regulating OS cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. siR-HOTAIR inhibited the proliferation of MG-63 cells due to the induction of G1 phase arrest. In addition, the results of in vitro assays demonstrated that the suppression of HOTAIR in MG-63 OS cells significantly reduced migration and invasion. The silencing of HOTAIR also significantly decreased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and MMP9, but increased E-cadherin expression through regulating the RAC \u03b1 serine/threonine protein kinase-mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. The results indicated that siR-HOTAIR may be a potential OS therapy.",

        "abstract": "This review summarizes the regenerative effects and molecular mechanisms of MSC-derived EVs, which have garnered attention as novel drug delivery systems, because they can specially encapsulate various target molecules. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer membrane particles that play critical roles in intracellular communication through EV-encapsulated informative content, including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells with self-renewal ability derived from bone marrow, fat, umbilical cord, menstruation blood, pulp, etc., which they use to induce tissue regeneration by their direct recruitment into injured tissues, including the heart, liver, lung, kidney, etc., or secreting factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor or insulin-like growth factor. Recently, MSC-derived EVs have been shown to have regenerative effects against various diseases, partially due to the post-transcriptional regulation of target genes by miRNAs. Furthermore, EVs have garnered attention as novel drug delivery systems, because they can specially encapsulate various target molecules. In this review, we summarize the regenerative effects and molecular mechanisms of MSC-derived EVs.",

        "abstract": "This study is the first-ever report to show that miR-34a regulates cell cycle factor Cdt2 by suppressing viral E6 protein level, thus opening up the possibility of exploring miR -34a as a specific therapy for cervical cancer treatment. MicroRNAs have emerged as an important regulator of cell cycle and various other cellular processes. Aberration in microRNAs has been linked with development of several cancers and other diseases but still very little is known about the mechanism by which they regulate these cellular events. High risk human papilloma virus (HR HPV) is the causative agent of 99% of cervical cancer cases which attenuates multiple tumor suppressors and checkpoint factors of the host cell. The viral proteins also stabilize many oncogenic factors, including an essential cell cycle regulator Cdt2/DTL which in turn promotes cell transformation and proliferation. In this study, we report that a micro-RNA, miR-34a by suppressing HPV E6 protein, destabilizes Cdt2/DTL protein level in HPV infected cervical cancer cell lines. Destabilization of Cdt2 stabilizes pro-apoptotic and onco-suppressor proteins like p21 and Set8 and suppresses cell proliferation, invasion and migration capabilities of the HPV positive cervical cancer cells. Overexpression of either HPV E6 or Cdt2 genes along with miR-34a restored back the suppressed proliferation rate. This study is the first-ever report to show that miR-34a regulates cell cycle factor Cdt2 by suppressing viral E6 protein level, thus opening up the possibility of exploring miR-34a as a specific therapy for cervical cancer treatment.",

        "abstract": "This article summarizes recent advances in the use and understanding of stem cell-derived ECMs and future directions to extend the spectrum of applications of stem- derived ECMs in tissue engineering by comprehensively elucidating and engineering their regulatory function is highlighted. Stem cells, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), have attracted considerable attention in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine primarily because of their unique ability in self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation. However, stem cells also have important secretory functions that form a specialized in vivo microenvironment and direct tissue development and regeneration. Extracellular matrices (ECMs) derived from stem cells retain the functional properties of their native environment and exhibit unique signaling that mediates stem cell self-renewal and lineage commitment. The stem cell-derived ECMs also have tunable properties corresponding to their developmental stages, suggesting that their lineage- and developmental specificity can be engineered for a wide range of applications. Hence, there is a growing interest in reconstructing stem cell microenvironment through decellularization and obtaining decellularized matrices that exhibit unique biological properties. This article summarizes recent advances in the use and understanding of stem cell-derived ECMs. Moreover, future directions to extend the spectrum of applications of stem-derived ECMs in tissue engineering by comprehensively elucidating and engineering their regulatory function is highlighted.",

        "abstract": "An improvement of the hepatocyte-like phenotype was achieved for an extended culture time suggesting a role of the epigenetic modifiers in hepatic differentiation and maturation and presenting hnMSC-HLCs as an advantageous alternative for drug discovery and in vitro toxicology testing. The development of predictive in vitro stem cell-derived hepatic models for toxicological drug screening is an increasingly important topic. Herein, umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hnMSCs) underwent hepatic differentiation using an optimized three-step core protocol of 24\u00a0days that mimicked liver embryogenesis with further exposure to epigenetic markers, namely the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), the cytidine analogue 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). FGF-2 and FGF-4 were also tested to improve endoderm commitment and foregut induction during Step 1 of the differentiation protocol, being HHEX expression increased with FGF-2 (4\u00a0ng/mL). DMSO (1%, v/v) when added at day 10 enhanced cell morphology, glycogen storage ability, enzymatic activity and induction capacity. Moreover, the stability of the hepatic phenotype under the optimized differentiation conditions was examined up to day 34. Our findings showed that hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) acquired the ability to metabolize glucose, produce albumin and detoxify ammonia. Global transcriptional analysis of the HLCs showed a partial hepatic differentiation degree. Global analysis of gene expression in the different cells revealed shared expression of gene groups between HLCs and human primary hepatocytes (hpHeps) that were not observed between HepG2 and hpHeps. In addition, bioinformatics analysis of gene expression data placed HLCs between the HepG2 cell line and hpHeps and distant from hnMSCs. The enhanced hepatic differentiation observed was supported by the presence of the hepatic drug transporters OATP-C and MRP-2 and gene expression of the hepatic markers CK18, TAT, AFP, ALB, HNF4A and CEBPA; and by their ability to display stable UGT-, EROD-, ECOD-, CYP1A1-, CYP2C9- and CYP3A4-dependent activities at levels either comparable with or even higher than those observed in primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. Overall, an improvement of the hepatocyte-like phenotype was achieved for an extended culture time suggesting a role of the epigenetic modifiers in hepatic differentiation and maturation and presenting hnMSC-HLCs as an advantageous alternative for drug discovery and in vitro toxicology testing.",

        "abstract": "Successful heart development depends on the careful orchestration of a network of transcription factors and signaling pathways. In recent years, the in vitro cardiac differentiation using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) has been used to uncover the intricate gene network regulation involved in the proper formation and function of the human heart. Here, we searched for uncharacterized cardiac developmental genes by combining a temporal evaluation of the human cardiac specification in vitro with the analysis of fetal and adult heart tissue gene expression. We discovered that CARDEL (CARdiac DEvelopment Long non-coding RNA; LINC00890; SERTM2) expression coincides with the commitment to the cardiac lineage. CARDEL knockout hPSCs differentiated poorly in cardiac cells, and hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes showed faster beating rates after CARDEL controlled overexpression during differentiation. Altogether, we demonstrate physiological and molecular evidence that CARDEL expression contributes to sculpting the cardiac program during cell-fate commitment.",

        "abstract": "This study shows that co-culturing hepatocytes with HSC has a good application prospect in the development of artificial liver technology and indicates that this new culture method is advantageous in enhancing cell viability and function. OBJECTIVE\nTo explore whether the function of the CL-1 hepatocytes, co-cultured with human hepatic stellate cells (HSC) on microcarriers was better than that cultured without HSC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nCL-1 hepatocytes were divided into 2 groups. The co-culture group was cultured with HSC in DMEM culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and HSC were not added in single-culture group. The cytomorphology was observed by inverted microscope and scanning electron microscopy. The effects of different culture method on the proliferation in vitro were analyzed by MTT assay. The function of hepatocytes was evaluated through measuring the concentration of ALT and albumin.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe inverted microscope and the MTT staining results showed that the quantity and viability of the human hepatocyte (C3A) in bidirectional bioreactor group were much better than the RCMW group. The growth curve results showed that the density of the human hepatocyte (C3A) was firstly increased and then decreased in both groups, and the peak of the curve appeared in day 5. The density of human liver cells in the second generation of bi-directional rotation and perfusion microgravity bioreactor group was significantly higher than the RCMW group from day1 to day 7 (P<0.05). The functional results showed that the albumin and urea concentration, which reached the peak on day 5, also gone up firstly and then gradually gone down in both teams. And the albumin and urea concentration in bidirectional bioreactor group was significantly higher than RCMW group from day 1 to day7 (P<0.01). Besides, the concentration of ALT and AST in bidirectional bioreactor group was significantly lower than RCMW group from day 1 to day 7 (P<0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis study shows that this new culture method is advantageous in enhancing cell viability and function. It indicates that co-culturing hepatocytes with HSC has a good application prospect in the development of artificial liver technology.",

        "abstract": "Focus is put on basic protocols to isolate hepatic stellate cells from human tissue and to maintain them in culture as well as on common in vitro assays to evaluate their response to profibrogenic factors. In vitro systems are required to evaluate potential liver fibrogenic effects of drugs and compounds during drug development and toxicity screening, respectively. Upon liver injury or toxicity, hepatic stellate cells are activated, thereby acquiring a myofibroblastic phenotype and participating in extracellular matrix deposition and liver fibrosis. The most widely used in vitro models to investigate liver fibrogenesis are primary cultures of hepatic stellate cells, which can be isolated from healthy human livers. Currently, there are no effective methods to maintain hepatic stellate cells in vitro in a quiescent phenotype. Therefore, when cells are plated, they spontaneously become activated in few days. Most in vitro studies in this area have been performed with monocultures of hepatic stellate cells in order to assess the direct effects of a given factor on hepatic stellate cell activation or the induction of inflammatory and fibrogenic responses. In this chapter, focus is put on basic protocols to isolate hepatic stellate cells from human tissue and to maintain them in culture as well as on common in vitro assays to evaluate their response to profibrogenic factors.",

        "abstract": "It is demonstrated that inflammation affects the immune properties of MSCs distinctly; whereas IFN\u03b3 primed WJMSCs were better suppressors of MLRs, which could utilize unique mechanisms of immune-modulation. Background Wharton's jelly derived stem cells (WJMSCs) are gaining attention as a possible clinical alternative to bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) owing to better accessibility, higher expansion potential and low immunogenicity. Usage of allogenic mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) could be permissible in vivo only if they retain their immune properties in an inflammatory setting. Thus the focus of this study is to understand and compare the immune properties of BMMSCs and WJMSCs primed with key pro-inflammatory cytokines, Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1). Methodology/Principal Findings Initially the effect of priming on MSC mediated suppression of alloantigen and mitogen induced lymphoproliferation was evaluated in vitro. Treatment with IFN\u03b3 or TNF\u03b1, did not ablate the immune-suppression caused by both the MSCs. Extent of immune-suppression was more with WJMSCs than BMMSCs in both the cases. Surprisingly, priming BMMSCs enhanced suppression of mitogen driven lymphoproliferation only; whereas IFN\u03b3 primed WJMSCs were better suppressors of MLRs. Further, kinetic analysis of cytokine profiles in co-cultures of primed/unprimed MSCs and Phytohematoagglutinin (PHA) activated lymphocytes was evaluated. Results indicated a decrease in levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, a change in kinetics and thresholds of Interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion was observed only with BMMSCs. Analysis of activation markers on PHA-stimulated lymphocytes indicated different expression patterns in co-cultures of primed/unprimed WJMSCs and BMMSCs. Strikingly, co-culture with WJMSCs resulted in an early activation of a negative co-stimulatory molecule, CTLA4, which was not evident with BMMSCs. A screen for immune suppressive factors in primed/unprimed WJMSCs and BMMSCs indicated inherent differences in IFN\u03b3 inducible Indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity, Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and Prostaglandin E-2 (PGE2) levels which could possibly influence the mechanism of immune-modulation. Conclusion/Significance This study demonstrates that inflammation affects the immune properties of MSCs distinctly. Importantly different tissue derived MSCs could utilize unique mechanisms of immune-modulation.",

        "abstract": "Recombinant spidroins have multiple properties beneficial for bioengineering, including their suitability for electrospinning and thus, for production of materials with oriented fibers, which makes RS-based matrices potentially effective in stimulating regeneration of peripheral nerves. Abstract Recombinant spidroins (RS; the analogues of silk proteins of spider\u2019s web) have multiple properties beneficial for bioengineering, including their suitability for electrospinning and thus, for production of materials with oriented fibers. This makes RS-based matrices potentially effective in stimulating regeneration of peripheral nerves. The restoration of injured nerves also depends on prompt regrowth of blood vessels. Therefore, prospective scaffold materials for neuro-regenerative therapy should positively affect both the nerves and the blood vessels. Currently, the experimental models suitable for culturing and quantitative assessment of the vascular and neuronal cells on the same material are lacking. Here, we assessed the suitability of electrospun RS-based matrices for cultivation of the mouse aorta and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) explants. We also quantified the effects of matrix topography upon both types of tissues. The RS-based materials have effectively supported aortic explants survival and sprouting. The cumulative length of endothelial sprouts on rS1/9-coated inserts was significantly higher as compared to type I collagen coatings, suggesting stimulatory effects on angiogenesis in vitro. In contrast to matrices with random fibers, on matrices with parallel fibers the migration of both smooth muscle and endothelial cells was highly oriented. Furthermore, alignment of RS fibers effectively directs the growth of axons and the migration of Schwann cells from DRGs. Thus, the electrospun RS matrices are highly suitable to culture both, the DRGs and aortic explants and to study the effects of matrix topography on cell migration. This model has a high potential for further endeavor into interactions of nerve and vascular cells and tissues.",

        "abstract": "Evidence is provided that hESCs can be differentiated efficiently in vitro to functional hepatocytes, which may be useful as an in vitro system for toxicity screening in drug discovery and evidence that the hESC\u2010derived hepatocytes are able to carry out a range of hepatocyte functions. The potential to differentiate human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in vitro to provide an unlimited source of human hepatocytes for use in biomedical research, drug discovery, and the treatment of liver diseases holds great promise. Here we describe a three\u2010stage process for the efficient and reproducible differentiation of hESCs to hepatocytes by priming hESCs towards definitive endoderm with activin A and sodium butyrate prior to further differentiation to hepatocytes with dimethyl sulfoxide, followed by maturation with hepatocyte growth factor and oncostatin M. We have demonstrated that differentiation of hESCs in this process recapitulates liver development in vivo: following initial differentiation, hESCs transiently express characteristic markers of the primitive streak mesendoderm before turning to the markers of the definitive endoderm; with further differentiation, expression of hepatocyte progenitor cell markers and mature hepatocyte markers emerged sequentially. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that the hESC\u2010derived hepatocytes are able to carry out a range of hepatocyte functions: storage of glycogen, and generation and secretion of plasma proteins. More importantly, the hESC\u2010derived hepatocytes express several members of cytochrome P450 isozymes, and these P450 isozymes are capable of converting the substrates to metabolites and respond to the chemical stimulation. Our results have provided evidence that hESCs can be differentiated efficiently in vitro to functional hepatocytes, which may be useful as an in vitro system for toxicity screening in drug discovery.",

        "abstract": "A study to optimize the time complexity of PCA (eigenfaces) that does not affects the recognition performance and minimize the participated eigenvectors which consequently decreases the computational time. Principle Component Analysis PCA is a classical feature extraction and data representation technique widely used in pattern recognition. It is one of the most successful techniques in face recognition. But it has drawback of high computational especially for big size database. This paper conducts a study to optimize the time complexity of PCA (eigenfaces) that does not affects the recognition performance. The authors minimize the participated eigenvectors which consequently decreases the computational time. A comparison is done to compare the differences between the recognition time in the original algorithm and in the enhanced algorithm. The performance of the original and the enhanced proposed algorithm is tested on face94 face database. Experimental results show that the recognition time is reduced by 35% by applying our proposed enhanced algorithm. DET Curves are used to illustrate the experimental results.",

        "abstract": "The generation of several iPS cell lines that are capable of generating viable, fertile live-born progeny by tetraploid complementation and confirm that iPS cells can attain true pluripotency that is similar to that of ES cells. Since the initial description of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells created by forced expression of four transcription factors in mouse fibroblasts, the technique has been used to generate embryonic stem (ES)-cell-like pluripotent cells from a variety of cell types in other species, including primates and rat. It has become a popular means to reprogram somatic genomes into an embryonic-like pluripotent state, and a preferred alternative to somatic-cell nuclear transfer and somatic-cell fusion with ES cells. However, iPS cell reprogramming remains slow and inefficient. Notably, no live animals have been produced by the most stringent tetraploid complementation assay, indicative of a failure to create fully pluripotent cells. Here we report the generation of several iPS cell lines that are capable of generating viable, fertile live-born progeny by tetraploid complementation. These iPS cells maintain a pluripotent potential that is very close to ES cells generated from in vivo or nuclear transfer embryos. We demonstrate the practicality of using iPS cells as useful tools for the characterization of cellular reprogramming and developmental potency, and confirm that iPS cells can attain true pluripotency that is similar to that of ES cells.",

        "abstract": "It was uncovered that the expression of Notch1 and Hes1 (the core factors of NotCh signaling pathway) was negatively regulated by HNF1A-AS1 knockdown, which promotes OSCC progression by activating Notch signaling pathway. ABSTRACT Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group of biomarkers which can regulate the biological processes of various human cancers. LncRNA HNF1A-AS1 has been reported in human cancers for its oncogenic role. This study focused on the biological function and molecular mechanism of HNF1A-AS1 in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The high expression of HNF1A-AS1 was examined in OSCC tissues and cell lines. Kaplan Meier method revealed that high expression of HNF1A-AS1 predicted poor prognosis for patients with OSCC. Results of loss-of-function assays demonstrated that silenced HNF1A-AS1 inhibited the proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of OSCC cells. Mechanically, HNF1A-AS1 was positively regulated by the transcription factor STAT3. Recently, Notch signaling pathway has been reported in human malignancies. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between HNF1A-AS1 and Notch signaling pathway. It was uncovered that the expression of Notch1 and Hes1 (the core factors of Notch signaling pathway) was negatively regulated by HNF1A-AS1 knockdown. Rescue assays further demonstrated the positive regulatory effects of HNF1A-AS1 on Notch signaling pathway in OSCC. In conclusion, upregulation of HNF1A-SA1 induced by transcription factor STAT3 promotes OSCC progression by activating Notch signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "A robust method for mapping the accessible genome of individual cells by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) integrated into a programmable microfluidics platform is developed and single-cell analysis of DNA accessibility provides new insight into cellular variation of the \u2018regulome\u2019. Cell-to-cell variation is a universal feature of life that affects a wide range of biological phenomena, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity. Although recent advances have improved our ability to document cellular phenotypic variation, the fundamental mechanisms that generate variability from identical DNA sequences remain elusive. Here we reveal the landscape and principles of mammalian DNA regulatory variation by developing a robust method for mapping the accessible genome of individual cells by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) integrated into a programmable microfluidics platform. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) maps from hundreds of single cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is systematically associated with specific trans-factors and cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors associated with either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell variability. We further identify sets of trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility variance across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability. The pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome recapitulates chromosome compartments de novo, linking single-cell accessibility variation to three-dimensional genome organization. Single-cell analysis of DNA accessibility provides new insight into cellular variation of the \u2018regulome\u2019.",

        "abstract": "The present review aimed to illustrate the main pathomechanisms involving cartilage and bone changes in TMJ OA and some therapeutic options that have shown potential restorative properties regarding these joint structures in vivo. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a specialized synovial joint that is crucial for the movement and function of the jaw. TMJ osteoarthritis (TMJ OA) is the result of disc dislocation, trauma, functional overburden, and developmental anomalies. TMJ OA affects all joint structures, including the articular cartilage, synovium, subchondral bone, capsule, ligaments, periarticular muscles, and sensory nerves that innervate the tissues. The present review aimed to illustrate the main pathomechanisms involving cartilage and bone changes in TMJ OA and some therapeutic options that have shown potential restorative properties regarding these joint structures in vivo. Chondrocyte loss, extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, and subchondral bone remodeling are important factors in TMJ OA. The subchondral bone actively participates in TMJ OA through an abnormal bone remodeling initially characterized by a loss of bone mass, followed by reparative mechanisms that lead to stiffness and thickening of the condylar osteochondral interface. In recent years, such therapies as intraarticular platelet-rich plasma (PRP), hyaluronic acid (HA), and mesenchymal stem cell-based treatment (MSCs) have shown promising results with respect to the regeneration of joint structures or the protection against further damage in TMJ OA. Nevertheless, PRP and MSCs are more frequently associated with cartilage and/or bone repair than HA. According to recent findings, the latter could enhance the restorative potential of other therapies (PRP, MSCs) when used in combination, rather than repair TMJ structures by itself. TMJ OA is a complex disease in which degenerative changes in the cartilage and bone develop through intricate mechanisms. The regenerative potential of such therapies as PRP, MSCs, and HA regarding the cartilage and subchondral bone (alone or in various combinations) in TMJ OA remains a matter of further research, with studies sometimes obtaining discrepant results.",

        "abstract": "Donkey sperm could be vitrified in straws obtaining better sperm motility parameters after warming in comparison to the sphere method, according to computer-assisted sperm analysis and plasma membrane integrity. Sperm vitrification as alternative to conventional freezing is increasing in popularity in many species. It has been achieved by direct exposure of diluted semen to liquid nitrogen in spheres or straws. Both techniques have been successfully developed, but they had not been compared yet in donkeys. The aim of this study was to compare these two methods of vitrification for donkey semen. Ejaculates from six Andalusian donkeys were collected and extended in Gent without glycerol supplemented with sucrose 0.1\u00a0M (Molar). Samples were slowly cooled at 5\u00b0C. For vitrification, 30\u00a0\u03bcl suspensions (spheres) were dropped directly into liquid nitrogen (LN2 ) or filled in covered 0.25\u00a0ml straws and then plunged into the LN2 (straws). For warming, straws and spheres were directly immersed in 3\u00a0ml of INRA-96 at 43\u00b0C. Total (TM, %) and progressive motility (PM, %) were objectively evaluated by computer-assisted sperm analysis and plasma membrane integrity (PMI, %) by epifluorescence microscopy. Results showed the straw method resulted in significantly higher values than spheres for: TM (54.7%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.1 vs. 28.6%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.5) and PM (44.2%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.4 vs. 17.7%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4), but no significant differences were found between straws or spheres for PMI (31.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.7 vs. 41.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.3) respectively. In conclusion, donkey sperm could be vitrified in straws obtaining better sperm motility parameters after warming in comparison to the sphere method.",

        "abstract": "It is shown that sustained E6/E7 expression is required to maintain the intracellular levels of members of the miR-17~92 cluster, which reduce expression of the anti-proliferative p21 gene in HPV-positive cancer cells. Specific types of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause cervical cancer. Cervical cancers exhibit aberrant cellular microRNA (miRNA) expression patterns. By genome-wide analyses, we investigate whether the intracellular and exosomal miRNA compositions of HPV-positive cancer cells are dependent on endogenous E6/E7 oncogene expression. Deep sequencing studies combined with qRT-PCR analyses show that E6/E7 silencing significantly affects ten of the 52 most abundant intracellular miRNAs in HPV18-positive HeLa cells, downregulating miR-17-5p, miR-186-5p, miR-378a-3p, miR-378f, miR-629-5p and miR-7-5p, and upregulating miR-143-3p, miR-23a-3p, miR-23b-3p and miR-27b-3p. The effects of E6/E7 silencing on miRNA levels are mainly not dependent on p53 and similarly observed in HPV16-positive SiHa cells. The E6/E7-regulated miRNAs are enriched for species involved in the control of cell proliferation, senescence and apoptosis, suggesting that they contribute to the growth of HPV-positive cancer cells. Consistently, we show that sustained E6/E7 expression is required to maintain the intracellular levels of members of the miR-17~92 cluster, which reduce expression of the anti-proliferative p21 gene in HPV-positive cancer cells. In exosomes secreted by HeLa cells, a distinct seven-miRNA-signature was identified among the most abundant miRNAs, with significant downregulation of let-7d-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-378a-3p, miR-423-3p, miR-7-5p, miR-92a-3p and upregulation of miR-21-5p, upon E6/E7 silencing. Several of the E6/E7-dependent exosomal miRNAs have also been linked to the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis. This study represents the first global analysis of intracellular and exosomal miRNAs and shows that viral oncogene expression affects the abundance of multiple miRNAs likely contributing to the E6/E7-dependent growth of HPV-positive cancer cells.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Liver transplantation is currently the only option for patients with end-stage liver disease. Thus, other alternate therapeutic strategies are needed. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are nonhematopoietic cells present in the bone marrow stroma that serve as precursors cells for various other cells. In this study, we evaluated the differentiation of porcine BM-MSCs into hepatocyte-like cells using three types of culture systems: hepatic induction medium (HIM), HIM/primary hepatocyte culture supernatant (HCS; 1:1 ratio), and a hepatocyte coculture system (HCCS; primary hepatocytes in the upper chamber, and BM-MSCs in the lower chamber). Primary hepatocytes were isolated from anesthetized healthy 1-month-old pigs by enzymatic digestion. Hepatic-specific marker expression (albumin [ALB], transferrin [TF], \u03b1-fetoprotein [AFP]), glycogen storage, low-density lipoprotein, and indocyanine green uptake were evaluated. Upregulation of hepatic-specific markers (ALB, TF, and AFP) was observed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in the HCCS group. Periodic acid-Schiff staining revealed enhanced glycogen storage in hepatocyte-like cells from the HCCS group compared with that from the HIM/HCS group. Furthermore, hepatocyte like-cells in the HCCS group showed improved LDL and ICG uptake than those in the other groups. Overall, our current study revealed that indirect coculture of primary hepatocytes and BM-MSCs enhanced the differentiation efficacy of BM-MSCs into hepatocyte-like cells by unknown useful soluble factors, including paracrine factors.",

        "abstract": "Functional human cardiomyocytes differentiated via these protocols may constitute a potential cell source for heart disease modeling, drug screening and cell-based therapeutic applications. The protocol described here efficiently directs human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to functional cardiomyocytes in a completely defined, growth factor\u2013 and serum-free system by temporal modulation of regulators of canonical Wnt signaling. Appropriate temporal application of a glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitor combined with the expression of \u03b2-catenin shRNA or a chemical Wnt inhibitor is sufficient to produce a high yield (0.8\u20131.3 million cardiomyocytes per cm2) of virtually pure (80\u201398%) functional cardiomyocytes in 14 d from multiple hPSC lines without cell sorting or selection. Qualitative (immunostaining) and quantitative (flow cytometry) characterization of differentiated cells is described to assess the expression of cardiac transcription factors and myofilament proteins. Flow cytometry of BrdU incorporation or Ki67 expression in conjunction with cardiac sarcomere myosin protein expression can be used to determine the proliferative capacity of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Functional human cardiomyocytes differentiated via these protocols may constitute a potential cell source for heart disease modeling, drug screening and cell-based therapeutic applications.",

        "abstract": "This differentiation protocol developed provides a promising approach for induction of hASC adipogenesis to obtain functional and mature human adipocytes, which were sensitive to insulin as observed from increased glucose uptake and inhibition of lipolysis. Adipose tissue related diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes are worldwide epidemics. In order to develop in vitro adipose tissue cultures which mimic more faithfully the physiology in vivo, new well characterized and publicly accepted differentiation methods of human adipose stem cells are needed. The aims of this study were (i) to improve the existing natural adipose tissue extract (ATE)-based induction method and (ii) to study the effects of differentiation method on insulin responsiveness of the resulting adipocytes. Different induction media were applied on human adipose stromal cell (hASC) monocultures to study the differentiation capacity of the induction media and the functionality of the differentiated adipocytes. Cells were differentiated for 14 days to assess triglyceride accumulation per cell and adipocyte-specific gene expression (PPAR , adiponectin, AP2, leptin, Glut4, Prdm16, CIDEA, PGC1, RIP140, UCP and ADCY5). Insulin response was studied by measuring glucose uptake and inhibition of lipolysis after incubation with 100 or 500 nM insulin. The selected differentiation method included 3-day induction with adipose tissue extract, 6 days in serumfree medium supplemented with 1.15 M insulin and 9.06 M Troglitazone, followed by 4 days in a defined serumand insulin-free stimulation medium. This protocol induced prominent general adipocyte gene expression, including markers for both brown and white adipocytes, and triglyceride accumulation. Moreover, the cells were sensitive to insulin as observed from increased glucose uptake and inhibition of lipolysis. This differentiation protocol developed provides a promising approach for induction of hASC adipogenesis to obtain functional and mature human adipocytes.",

        "abstract": "It is shown that PTBP1 affects the invasion and metastasis of hepatoma cells by modulating the alternative splicing of Axl exon 10, and the biological significance ofAxl-S and PTBP 1 in tumor metastasis is highlighted. The Axl gene is known to encode for a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in the metastasis process of cancer. In this study, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanism of Axl alternative splicing. Methods: The expression levels of PTBP1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues were obtained from TCGA samples and cell lines. The effect of Axl-L, Axl-S, and PTBP1 on cell growth, migration, invasion tumor formation, and metastasis of liver cancer cells were measured by cell proliferation, wound-healing, invasion, xenograft tumor formation, and metastasis. Interaction between PTBP1 and Axl was explored using cross-link immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down assays and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Results: Knockdown of the PTBP1 and exon 10 skipping isoform of Axl (Axl-S), led to impaired invasion and metastasis in hepatoma cells. Immunoprecipitation results indicated that Axl-S protein binds more robustly with Gas6 ligand than Axl-L (exon 10 including) and is more capable of promoting phosphorylation of ERK and AKT proteins. Furthermore, cross-link immunoprecipitation and RNA-pulldown assays revealed that PTBP1 binds to the polypyrimidine sequence(TCCTCTCTGTCCTTTCTTC) on Axl-Intron 9. MS2-GFP-IP experiments demonstrated that PTBP1 competes with U2AF2 for binding to the aforementioned polypyrimidine sequence, thereby inhibiting alternative splicing and ultimately promoting Axl-S production. Conclusion: Our results highlight the biological significance of Axl-S and PTBP1 in tumor metastasis, and show that PTBP1 affects the invasion and metastasis of hepatoma cells by modulating the alternative splicing of Axl exon 10.",

        "abstract": "Successful reprogramming of human fibroblasts after more than 20 passages in vitro, to a pluripotent state with four transcription factors: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc is reported. It is possible to generate induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from mouse and human somatic cells by ectopic expression of defined sets of transcription factors. However, the recommendation that somatic cells should be utilized at early passages for induced reprogramming limits their therapeutic application. Here we report successful reprogramming of human fibroblasts after more than 20 passages in vitro, to a pluripotent state with four transcription factors: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. The late passage-derived human iPS cells resemble human embryonic stem cells in morphology, cell surface antigens, pluripotent gene expression profiles, and epigenetic states. Moreover, these iPS cells differentiate into cell types representative of the three germ layers in teratomas in vivo, and directed neuronal differentiation in vitro.",

        "abstract": "WJ-MSCs primed by TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 may represent a promising tool to treat the autoimmune disorders and can provide a new evidence to consider MSCs- based therapeutic approach for the treatment of TID. The unique immunomodulation and immunosuppressive potential of Wharton\u2019s jelly-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (WJ-MSCs) make them a promising therapeutic approach for autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes (T1D). The immunomodulatory effect of MSCs is exerted either by cell-cell contact or by secretome secretion. Cell-cell contact is a critical mechanism by which MSCs regulate immune-responses and generate immune regulatory cells such as tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDCs) and regulatory T cell (Tregs). In this study, we primed WJ-MSCs with TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 and investigated the immunomodulatory properties of primed WJ-MSCs on mature dendritic cells (mDCs) and activated T cells differentiated from mononuclear cells (MNCs) of T1D patient\u2019s. Our findings revealed that primed WJ-MSCs impaired the antigen-mediated immunity, upregulated immune-tolerance genes and downregulated immune-response genes. We also found an increase in the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and suppression of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Significant upregulation of FOXP3, IL10 and TGFB1 augmented an immunosuppressive effect on adaptive T cell immunity which represented a strong evidence in support of the formation of Tregs. Furthermore, upregulation of many critical genes involved in the immune-tolerance mechanism (IDO1 and PTGES2/PTGS) was detected. Interestingly, upregulation of ENTPD1/NT5E genes express a strong evidence to switch immunostimulatory response toward immunoregulatory response. We conclude that WJ-MSCs primed by TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 may represent a promising tool to treat the autoimmune disorders and can provide a new evidence to consider MSCs- based therapeutic approach for the treatment of TID.",

        "abstract": "An investigation revealed that the use of CCs consisting of a mixture of two RSs and FPs with different peptide motifs of ECMs increased the efficiency of obtaining neurons differentiated from iPSCs compared to Matrigel. The production and transplantation of functionally active human neurons is a promising approach to cell therapy. Biocompatible and biodegradable matrices that effectively promote the growth and directed differentiation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) into the desired neuronal types are very important. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of novel composite coatings (CCs) containing recombinant spidroins (RSs) rS1/9 and rS2/12 in combination with recombinant fused proteins (FP) carrying bioactive motifs (BAP) of the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins for the growth of NPCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and their differentiation into neurons. NPCs were produced by the directed differentiation of human iPSCs. The growth and differentiation of NPCs cultured on different CC variants were compared with a Matrigel (MG) coating using qPCR analysis, immunocytochemical staining, and ELISA. An investigation revealed that the use of CCs consisting of a mixture of two RSs and FPs with different peptide motifs of ECMs increased the efficiency of obtaining neurons differentiated from iPSCs compared to Matrigel. CC consisting of two RSs and FPs with Arg\u2013Gly\u2013Asp\u2013Ser (RGDS) and heparin binding peptide (HBP) is the most effective for the support of NPCs and their neuronal differentiation.",

        "abstract": "The results indicate that functional HLC generated by this method can be utilized in regenerative medicine and as a screening platform in the discovery and development of new drugs. Hepatocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) promise to be an inexhaustible source of functional cells for use in biomedical research, drug discovery and treatment of liver diseases. We have developed a unique strategy to efficiently differentiate hESC into functional hepatocyte-like cells (HLC) in vitro. The robustness of our protocol was assessed by duplicating the process of differentiation in two of our in house derived hESC lines, Relicell \u00ae hES1 and Relicell \u00ae hES2, and in the well studied BG01 cell line. To induce early hepatic commitment, undifferentiated hESC were initially primed with conditioned medium from HepG2, a human hepatoma cell line, which resulted in an enriched population of definitive endoderm. We have also attempted to recapitulate the hepatogenetic events occurring in vivo by sequential application of growth factors involved in liver development, such as aFGF, HGF, oncostatin, dexamethasone and EGF. Our differentiation process yielded a homogenous population of HLC exhibiting the typical polygonal morphology of hepatocytes. This population expressed hepatic lineage markers including HNF4\u03b1, AFP and ALBUMIN, and drug metabolizing enzymes such as CYP3A4 (Phase I) and GSTA1 (Phase II). Flow cytometric analysis showed that over 70% of the differentiated cells expressed albumin and CK8/18. The differentiated HLC exhibited hepatic characteristics such as glycogen storage and production of albumin and urea. Our results indicate that functional HLC generated by this method can be utilized in regenerative medicine and as a screening platform in the discovery and development of new drugs.",

Face recognition has the most relevance in real life issues of security, criminal investigation, and verification intention. Thus it has a broad range of applications. Three issues in the field of face recognition are: illumination variation , pose variation and more importantly expression variation which is the main focus of this paper. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used technology about dimensional reduction. Recently, the PCA has been extensively employed for face recognition algorithms. It is one of the most popular representation methods for a face image. It not only reduces the dimensionality of the image, but also retains some of the variations in the image data. The proposed method has been evaluated using the Feedtum database. Experimental results show that the proposed method has encouraging recognition performance.",

        "abstract": "It seems essential to undertake studies that will resolve the impact of chemical and environmental factors on chromatin structure and epigenetic components of human spermatozoa and to elucidate what sperm nuclear end-points are predictors of the quality of progeny outcome. The integrity of the paternal genome is essential as the spermatozoon can bring genetic damage into the oocyte at fertilization and contribute to the development of abnormal pregnancy outcome. During the past two decades, many assays have been developed to measure sperm DNA strand breaks, chromatin structure and compaction and assess the proteins associated with the DNA, as well as epigenetic modifications. Using these assays, it has been shown that exposure to physical agents or chemicals, including therapeutic drugs and environmental toxicants, can affect the integrity of sperm chromatin, inducing structural, genetic and/or epigenetic abnormalities. The mechanisms by which such damage is triggered are still largely unresolved and the susceptibility of each individual will depend on their genetic background, lifestyle and exposure to various insults. Depending on the nature of the chemicals, they may directly target the DNA, induce an oxidative stress, or modify the epigenetic elements. The significance of measuring the sperm chromatin integrity comes from the fact that this end-point correlates well with the low IVF and ICSI outcomes, and idiopathic infertility. Nevertheless, it is hard to establish a direct link between the paternal sperm chromatin integrity and the health of the future generations. Thus, it seems essential to undertake studies that will resolve the impact of chemical and environmental factors on chromatin structure and epigenetic components of human spermatozoa and to elucidate what sperm nuclear end-points are predictors of the quality of progeny outcome.",

Infertility has been recognized as a civilizational disease. One of the most common causes of infertility is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Closely interrelated immunometabolic mechanisms underlie the development of this complex syndrome and lead to infertility. The direct cause of infertility in PCOS is ovulation and implantation disorders caused by low-grade inflammation of ovarian tissue and endometrium which, in turn, result from immune and metabolic system disorders. The systemic immune response, in particular the inflammatory response, in conjunction with metabolic disorders, insulin resistance (IR), hyperadrenalism, insufficient secretion of progesterone, and oxidative stress lead not only to cardiovascular diseases, cancer, autoimmunity, and lipid metabolism disorders but also to infertility. Depending on the genetic and environmental conditions as well as certain cultural factors, some diseases may occur immediately, while others may become apparent years after an infertility diagnosis. Each of them alone can be a significant factor contributing to the development of PCOS and infertility. Further research will allow clinical management protocols to be established for PCOS patients experiencing infertility so that a targeted therapy approach can be applied to the factor underlying and driving the \u201cvicious circle\u201d alongside symptomatic treatment and ovulation stimulation. Hence, therapy of fertility for PCOS should be conducted by interdisciplinary teams of specialists as an in-depth understanding of the molecular relationships and clinical implications between the immunological and metabolic factors that trigger reproductive system disorders is necessary to restore the physiology and homeostasis of the body and, thus, fertility, among PCOS patients.",

        "abstract": "A critical regulatory role of the lncRNA gene Platr22 is revealed in modulating the activity of a nearby SE and the expression of the nearby pluripotency regulator ZFP281, highlighting an unanticipated role for a class of lncRNAs in epigenetically controlling the activity and vulnerability to perturbation of nearby SEs for cell fate determination. Abstract Super-enhancers (SEs) comprise large clusters of enhancers, which are co-occupied by multiple lineage-specific and master transcription factors, and play pivotal roles in regulating gene expression and cell fate determination. However, it is still largely unknown whether and how SEs are regulated by the noncoding portion of the genome. Here, through genome-wide analysis, we found that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes preferentially lie next to SEs. In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), depletion of SE-associated lncRNA transcripts dysregulated the activity of their nearby SEs. Specifically, we revealed a critical regulatory role of the lncRNA gene Platr22 in modulating the activity of a nearby SE and the expression of the nearby pluripotency regulator ZFP281. Through these regulatory events, Platr22 contributes to pluripotency maintenance and proper differentiation of mESCs. Mechanistically, Platr22 transcripts coat chromatin near the SE region and interact with DDX5 and hnRNP-L. DDX5 further recruits p300 and other factors related to active transcription. We propose that these factors assemble into a transcription hub, thus promoting an open and active epigenetic chromatin state. Our study highlights an unanticipated role for a class of lncRNAs in epigenetically controlling the activity and vulnerability to perturbation of nearby SEs for cell fate determination.",

        "abstract": "Comparison of iPS cells from embryonic origin (MEF), progenitor cells (neural stem cells) or differentiated somatic cells (TTF) reveals that fully pluripotent developmental potential can be reached by each cell type, although with different induction efficiencies. Previous studies demonstrated that induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells could produce viable mice through tetraploid complementation, which was thought to be the most stringent test for pluripotency. However, these highly pluripotent iPS cells were previously reported to be generated from fibroblasts of embryonic origin. Achieving fully pluripotent iPS cells from multiple cell types, especially easily accessible adult tissues, will lead to a much greater clinical impact. We successfully generated high-pluripotency iPS cells from adult tail tip fibroblasts (TTF) that resulted in viable, full-term, fertile TTF-iPS animals with no obvious teratoma formation or other developmental abnormalities. Comparison of iPS cells from embryonic origin (MEF), progenitor cells (neural stem cells) or differentiated somatic cells (TTF) reveals that fully pluripotent developmental potential can be reached by each cell type, although with different induction efficiencies. This work provides the means for studying the mechanisms and regulation of direct reprogramming, and has encouraging implications for future clinical applications and therapeutic interventions.",

        "abstract": "The role of the lncRNA SLC16A1-AS1 in OSCC growth is comprehensively investigated and it is proved that it may serve as a new diagnostic indicator and a new target for the treatment of OSCC. ABSTRACT Altered expressions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are potential cancer prognostic biomarkers that play a critical role in the development of tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancer. However, the relationship between the expression of lncRNAs in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and the diagnosis, progression, and prognosis of OSCC has not been thoroughly elucidated. To identify the differentially expressed lncRNAs between OSCC tissue and normal tissue, RNA-Seq data were used. lncRNA SLC16A1-AS1 was significantly highly expressed in OSCC samples than that in normal samples. Systematic bioinformatics analysis revealed that SLC16A1-AS1 was associated with histological tumor grades and overall survival status, as well as copy number variation, somatic mutation, tumor mutation burden, tumor stemness, tumor microenvironment and infiltrating immune cells. According to three advanced bioinformatic algorithms prediction (WGCNA, GSEA and GSVA), SLC16A1-AS1 played an essential role in OSCC proliferation and its biological function was related to cell-cycle regulation. Loss-of-function experiments were performed to determine the biological functions of SLC16A1-AS in OSCC cells. Silencing SLC16A1-AS1 significantly reduced the cell proliferation rate and colony-forming ability in both CAL27 and SCC25 cell lines. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis revealed that SLC16A1-AS1 silencing induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibited the expression of cyclin D1 in both CAL27 and SCC25 cells. In conclusion, our study comprehensively investigated the role of the lncRNA SLC16A1-AS1 in OSCC growth and proved that it may serve as a new diagnostic indicator and a new target for the treatment of OSCC.",

        "abstract": "Basic features of the osteochondral junction, which comprises subchondral bone and articular cartilage, are summarized and a hypothetical model for the pathogenesis of OA is proposed. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of disability in the adult population. As a progressive degenerative joint disorder, OA is characterized by cartilage damage, changes in the subchondral bone, osteophyte formation, muscle weakness, and inflammation of the synovium tissue and tendon. Although OA has long been viewed as a primary disorder of articular cartilage, subchondral bone is attracting increasing attention. It is commonly reported to play a vital role in the pathogenesis of OA. Subchondral bone sclerosis, together with progressive cartilage degradation, is widely considered as a hallmark of OA. Despite the increase in bone volume fraction, subchondral bone is hypomineralized, due to abnormal bone remodeling. Some histopathological changes in the subchondral bone have also been detected, including microdamage, bone marrow edema-like lesions and bone cysts. This review summarizes basic features of the osteochondral junction, which comprises subchondral bone and articular cartilage. Importantly, we discuss risk factors influencing subchondral bone integrity. We also focus on the microarchitectural and histopathological changes of subchondral bone in OA, and provide an overview of their potential contribution to the progression of OA. A hypothetical model for the pathogenesis of OA is proposed.",

        "abstract": "Findings confirm that sperm vitrification can be performed in donkeys as an alternative to conventional freezing for AI in jennies and also confirm that the uterine inflammatory response solved faster, and pregnancy rates were greater than frozen semen. Artificial insemination (AI) with cryopreserved semen is an important tool to preserve endangered species, including European donkey breeds. Sperm vitrification is an alternative method to conventional freezing using high cooling rates and non-permeable cryoprotectant agents (CPAs). In donkeys, sperm vitrification was firstly developed in spheres by directly dropping the sperm (30\u00a0\u00b5l) into the liquid nitrogen. The vitrification media contained a combination of sucrose and bovine serum albumin as non-permeable CPAs and resulted in better sperm parameters after warming than extenders containing glycerol. Thereafter, sperm vitrification was optimized using an aseptic protocol, which consists of volumes up to 160\u00a0\u00b5l vitrified at 300\u00a0million sperm/ml using 0.25-ml straws with outer covers, obtaining similar sperm parameters as conventional freezing for total motility (52.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.6% versus. 58.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.1%), progressive motility (44.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.0% versus. 44.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.2%) and plasma membrane integrity (49.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.2% versus. 55.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.0%), respectively. In order to vitrify larger volumes of sperm, a procedure using 0.5-ml straws was evaluated; however, this methodology failed when compared to conventional freezing or other vitrification protocols, obtaining poor sperm quality after warming. Recently, a new methodology was developed for warming 0.25-ml straws in a water bath and after AI using the vitrified sperm, the uterine inflammatory response solved faster, and pregnancy rates were greater (22%) than frozen semen (10%) but not statistically different. In conclusion, all these findings confirm that sperm vitrification can be performed in donkeys as an alternative to conventional freezing for AI in jennies.",

        "abstract": "It is demonstrated that HPV16 E7 could increase DGCR8 to promote the generation of miR-27b, which accelerated cell proliferation and inhibited paclitaxel-induced cell apoptosis through down-regulating PLK2. The infection with high-risk human papillomavirus is linked to cervical cancer, nevertheless, the role of miRNAs regulated by HPV oncogenes in cancer progression remain largely unknown. Here, we knocked down endogenous E6/E7 in HPV16-positive CaSki cell lines, screened differences in miRNA expression profile with control using miRNA array. 38 miRNAs were down-regulated and 6 miRNAs were up-regulated in the E6/E7 silenced CaSki cells (>2-fold changes with P <0.05). The levels of miR-27b, miR-20a, miR-24, miR-93, and miR-106b were verified by qPCR in E6/E7 silenced CaSki and SiHa cells. MiR-27b, up-regulated by E7, promoted CaSki and SiHa cell proliferation and invasion, inhibit paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Dual-luciferase experiment confirmed miR-27b down-regulated its target gene PLK2 through the \u201cseed regions\u201d. The tumor suppressor PLK2 inhibited SiHa cell proliferation, reduced cell viability, and promoted paclitaxel/cisplatin -induced apoptosis. Furthermore, DGCR8 was found to mediate the up-regulation of miR-27b by HPV16 E7. Our study demonstrated that HPV16 E7 could increase DGCR8 to promote the generation of miR-27b, which accelerated cell proliferation and inhibited paclitaxel-induced cell apoptosis through down-regulating PLK2. These findings provide an insight into the interaction network of viral oncogene, miR-27b and PLK2, and support the potential strategies using antisense nucleic acid of miR-27b for therapy of cervical cancer in the future.",

        "abstract": "The interplay between damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and antigens as the main inducers of innate and adaptive immunity to aid in manufacturing biocompatible grafts with desirable immunogenicity is discussed. Tissue-engineered decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds hold great potential to address the donor shortage as well as immunologic rejection attributed to cells in conventional tissue/organ transplantation. Decellularization, as the key process in manufacturing ECM scaffolds, removes immunogen cell materials and significantly alleviates the immunogenicity and biocompatibility of derived scaffolds. However, the application of these bioscaffolds still confronts major immunologic challenges. This review discusses the interplay between damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and antigens as the main inducers of innate and adaptive immunity to aid in manufacturing biocompatible grafts with desirable immunogenicity. It also appraises the impact of various decellularization methodologies (i.e., apoptosis-assisted techniques) on provoking immune responses that participate in rejecting allogenic and xenogeneic decellularized scaffolds. In addition, the key research findings regarding the contribution of ECM alterations, cytotoxicity issues, graft sourcing, and implantation site to the immunogenicity of decellularized tissues/organs are comprehensively considered. Finally, it discusses practical solutions to overcome immunogenicity, including antigen masking by crosslinking, sterilization optimization, and antigen removal techniques such as selective antigen removal and sequential antigen solubilization.",

        "abstract": "An overview regarding the therapeutic effects of the MSCs and their exosomes in ALF is delivered and recent progress in preclinical and clinical studies and current challenges are discussed, with a special focus on in vivo reports. Recently, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and their derivative exosome have become a promising approach in the context of liver diseases therapy, in particular, acute liver failure (ALF). In addition to their differentiation into hepatocytes in vivo, which is partially involved in liver regeneration, MSCs support liver regeneration as a result of their appreciated competencies, such as antiapoptotic, immunomodulatory, antifibrotic, and also antioxidant attributes. Further, MSCs-secreted molecules inspire hepatocyte proliferation in vivo, facilitating damaged tissue recovery in ALF. Given these properties, various MSCs-based approaches have evolved and resulted in encouraging outcomes in ALF animal models and also displayed safety and also modest efficacy in human studies, providing a new avenue for ALF therapy. Irrespective of MSCs-derived exosome, MSCs-based strategies in ALF include administration of native MSCs, genetically modified MSCs, pretreated MSCs, MSCs delivery using biomaterials, and also MSCs in combination with and other therapeutic molecules or modalities. Herein, we will deliver an overview regarding the therapeutic effects of the MSCs and their exosomes in ALF. As well, we will discuss recent progress in preclinical and clinical studies and current challenges in MSCs-based therapies in ALF, with a special focus on in vivo reports.",

Here, we describe how to efficiently direct human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) differentiation into self-renewing epicardial cells in a completely defined, xeno-free system by temporal modulation of regulators of canonical Wnt signaling. Appropriate differentiation-stage-specific application of Gsk3 inhibitor, Wnt inhibitor, and Gsk3 inhibitor (GiWiGi) is sufficient to produce cells expressing epicardial markers and exhibiting epicardial phenotypes with a high yield and purity from multiple hPSC lines in 16 d. Characterization of differentiated cells is performed via flow cytometry and immunostaining to assess quantitative expression and localization of epicardial cell\u2013specific proteins. In vitro differentiation into fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is also described. In addition, culture in the presence of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 inhibitors allows long-term expansion of hPSC-derived epicardial cells (for at least 25 population doublings). Functional human epicardial cells differentiated via this protocol may constitute a potential cell source for heart disease modeling, drug screening, and cell-based therapeutic applications.",

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are nonparenchymal liver cells responsible for extracellular matrix homeostasis and are the main cells involved in the development of liver fibrosis following injury. The lack of reliable sources of HSCs has hence limited the development of complex in vitro systems to model liver diseases and toxicity. Here we describe a protocol to differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into hepatic stellate cells (iPSC-HSCs). The protocol is based on the addition of several growth factors important for liver development sequentially over 12 d. iPSC-HSCs present phenotypic and functional characteristics of primary HSCs and can be expanded or frozen and used to perform high-throughput in vitro studies. We also describe how to coculture iPSC-HSCs with hepatocytes, which self-assemble into three-dimensional (3D) hepatic spheroids. This protocol enables the generation of HSC-like cells for in vitro modeling and drug screening studies. Human iPSCs are differentiated into HSCs by culture with growth factors. They respond to fibrogenic stimuli, arising as a new source of HSC-like cells for in vitro modeling. Subsequent coculture with hepatocytes facilitates self-assembly into 3D hepatic spheroids.",

        "abstract": "In vitro adipogenic differentiation of h ASCs improves their ability to support endothelial viable cell numbers and suggests that hASCs differentiated for a short period potentially improve angiogenic responses for in vivo implantation. BACKGROUND\nImproving vascularization of engineered adipose tissue constructs is a major challenge in the field of plastic surgery. Although human adipose-derived stromal cells (hASCs) are known to release factors that stimulate new blood vessel formation, detailed information about the effects of adipogenic differentiation on the angiogenic potential of hASCs remains largely unknown. In the present study, we studied the expression and secretion of a large panel of angiogenic factors during hASC differentiation and evaluated the effects of hASC-conditioned medium (hASC-CM) on endothelial cells.\n\n\nMETHODS\nhASCs were cultured on adipogenic medium or basal medium. Conditioned medium was collected, and cells were harvested following 0, 3, 7, 14, and 22 days of culture. The stage of adipogenic differentiation of hASC was assessed using Oil Red O staining, fatty acid binding protein-4 gene expression, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGene expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placental growth factor, angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1), angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2), and protein secretion of VEGF significantly increased during short-term adipogenic differentiation of hASCs. Moreover, conditioned medium from differentiated hASCs strongly enhanced endothelial cell numbers compared to conditioned medium from undifferentiated hASCs.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn vitro adipogenic differentiation of hASCs improves their ability to support endothelial viable cell numbers and suggests that hASCs differentiated for a short period potentially improve angiogenic responses for in vivo implantation.",

        "abstract": "Experimental evidence is provided that SRA1 exon 3 inclusion is up regulated by SRSF1 to promote tumor invasion and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma. Steroid receptor RNA activator 1 ( SRA1 ) has been described as a novel transcriptional co-activator that affects the migration of cancer cells. Through RT-PCR, we identified that skipping exon 3 of SRA1 produces two isoforms, including the truncated short isoform, SRA1-S, and the long isoform, SRA1-L. However, the effect of these two isomers on the migration of HCC cells, as well as the specific mechanism of exon 3 skipping remain unclear. In this study, we found up regulated expression of SRSF1 and SRA1-L in highly metastatic HCCLM3, as well as in HCCs with SRSF1 demonstrating the strongest correlation with SRA1-L. In contrast, we observed a constitutively low expression of SRA1-S and SRSF1 in lowly metastatic HepG2 cells. Overexpression of SRSF1 or SRA1-L promoted migration and invasion by increasing the expression of CD44, while SRA1-S reversed the effect of SRSF1 and SRA1-L in vitro. In addition, lung metastasis in mice revealed that, knockdown of SRSF1 or SRA1-L inhibited the migration of HCC cells, while SRA1-L overexpression abolished the effect of SRSF1 knockout and instead promoted HCC cells migration in vivo. More importantly, RNA immunoprecipitation and Cross-link immunoprecipitation analyses showed that SRSF1 interacts with exon 3 of SRA1 to up regulate the expression of SRA1-L in HCC cells. RNA pull-down results indicated that SRSF1 could also bind to exon 3 of SRA1 in vitro. Finally, minigene -MS2 mutation experiments showed that mutation of the SRA1 exon 3 binding site for SRSF1 prevented the binding of SRA1 pre-mRNA. In summary, our results provide experimental evidence that SRA1 exon 3 inclusion is up regulated by SRSF1 to promote tumor invasion and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma.",

        "abstract": "UCMSCs are an excellent alternative to BM in immunosuppressive therapy: they express high concentrations of inhibitory molecules and can be cultivated without stimuli, which minimizes cost. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been used in immunosuppressive therapy due to their therapeutic effects, with the HLA-G molecule seeming to play a fundamental role. This work evaluated alternative MSC sources to bone marrow (BM), namely, umbilical cord tissue (UC), adipose tissue (AD) and dental pulp tissue (DP), and the influence of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and hypoxia on the cultivation of these cells for use in immunosuppression therapies. Expression of costimulatory markers CD40, CD80 and CD86 and immunosuppressive molecules CD152 and HLA-G was analyzed. Lymphocyte inhibition assays were also performed. Sequencing of the HLA-G gene from exons 1 to 5 was performed using next-generation sequencing to determine the presence of alleles. UC-derived MSCs (UCMSCs) expressed higher CD152 and HLA-G1 under standard cultivation. UCMSCs and DP-derived MSCs (DPSCs) secreted similar levels of HLA-G5. All MSC sources inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs); growth under regular versus hypoxic conditions resulted in similar levels of inhibition. When IFN-\u03b3 was added, PBMC growth was inhibited to a lesser extent by UCMSCs. The HLA-G*01:04:01:01 allele appears to generate a more efficient MSC response in inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation. However, the strength of this conclusion was limited by the small sample size. UCMSCs are an excellent alternative to BM in immunosuppressive therapy: they express high concentrations of inhibitory molecules and can be cultivated without stimuli, which minimizes cost.",

        "abstract": "It has been found for the first time that drNPCs on SBEM mostly preserve their stemness in the growth medium and even in the differentiation medium with brain- derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophicfactor, while addition of the mentioned ECM-peptide motifs may shift the balance toward neuroglial differentiation. The interaction of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) with the extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in neural tissue regeneration. Understanding which motifs of the ECM proteins are crucial for normal NPC adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation is important in order to create more adequate tissue engineered models of neural tissue and to efficiently study the central nervous system regeneration mechanisms. We have shown earlier that anisotropic matrices prepared from a mixture of recombinant dragline silk proteins, such as spidroin 1 and spidroin 2, by electrospinning are biocompatible with NPCs and provide good proliferation and oriented growth of neurites. This study objective was to find the effects of spidroin-based electrospun materials, modified with peptide motifs of the extracellular matrix proteins (RGD, IKVAV, and VAEIDGIEL) on adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of directly reprogrammed neural precursor cells (drNPCs). The structural and biomechanical studies have shown that spidroin-based electrospun mats (SBEM), modified with ECM peptides, are characterized by a uniaxial orientation and elastic moduli in the swollen state, comparable to those of the dura mater. It has been found for the first time that drNPCs on SBEM mostly preserve their stemness in the growth medium and even in the differentiation medium with brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, while addition of the mentioned ECM-peptide motifs may shift the balance toward neuroglial differentiation. We have demonstrated that the RGD motif promotes formation of a lower number of neurons with longer neurites, while the IKVAV motif is characterized by formation of a greater number of NF200-positive neurons with shorter neurites. At the same time, all the studied matrices preserve up to 30% of neuroglial progenitor cells, phenotypically similar to radial glia derived from the subventricular zone. We believe that, by using this approach and modifying spidroin by various ECM-motifs or other substances, one may create an in vitro model for the neuroglial stem cell niche with the potential control of their differentiation.",

Hepatocytes generated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are considered to be an excellent candidate for restoring the liver function deficiencies. We have earlier standardized a three\u2010step differentiation protocol to generate functional hepatocyte\u2010like cells (HLCs) from hESCs, which expressed the major hepatic markers. We have also found that the HLCs remain stable and functional even after extended period of in vitro culture and cryopreservation. In the present study, we have aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of cryopreserved\u2010thawed hESC\u2010derived hepatic progenitor cells following transplantation in carbon tetrachloride\u2010induced fibrotic rat livers. Significant therapeutic effects, including improved hepatic histology and normal serum biochemistry of hepatic enzymes along with increased survival rate, were observed in the cell transplanted rats. This result is an encouraging indication to develop methods for clinical application of hESC\u2010derived hepatic lineage cells.",

        "abstract": "A comprehensive FER review in three different machine learning problem definitions is provided: Single Label Learning (SLL)- which presents FER as a multiclass problem, Multilabel Learning (MLL)- that resolves the ambiguity nature of FER, and Label Distribution Learning- that recovers the distribution of emotion in FER data annotation. Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is presently the aspect of cognitive and affective computing with the most attention and popularity, aided by its vast application areas. Several studies have been conducted on FER, and many review works are also available. The existing FER review works only give an account of FER models capable of predicting the basic expressions. None of the works considers intensity estimation of an emotion; neither do they include studies that address data annotation inconsistencies and correlation among labels in their works. This work first introduces some identified FER application areas and provides a discussion on recognised FER challenges. We proceed to provide a comprehensive FER review in three different machine learning problem definitions: Single Label Learning (SLL)- which presents FER as a multiclass problem, Multilabel Learning (MLL)- that resolves the ambiguity nature of FER, and Label Distribution Learning- that recovers the distribution of emotion in FER data annotation. We also include studies on expression intensity estimation from the face. Furthermore, popularly employed FER models are thoroughly and carefully discussed in handcrafted, conventional machine learning and deep learning models. We finally itemise some recognise unresolved issues and also suggest future research areas in the field.",

        "abstract": "This study provides a foundation for understanding the dynamic regulation of lncRNA transcriptomes during ESC differentiation and identifies the interplay between epitranscriptomic modification and key lncRNAs in the regulation of cell fate decision. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as vital regulators of gene expression during embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal and differentiation. Here, we systemically analyzed the differentially regulated lncRNAs during ESC-derived cardiomyocyte (CM) differentiation. We established a perspicuous profile of lncRNA expression at four critical developmental stages and found that the differentially expressed lncRNAs were grouped into six distinct clusters. The cluster with specific expression in ESC enriches the largest number of lncRNAs. Investigation of lncRNA-protein interaction network revealed that they are not only controlled by classic key transcription factors, but also modulated by epigenetic and epitranscriptomic factors including N6-methyladenosine (m6A) effector machineries. A detailed inspection revealed that 28 out of 385 lncRNAs were modified by methylation as well as directly recruited by the nuclear m6A reader protein Ythdc1. Unlike other 27 non-coding transcripts, the ESC-specific lncRNA Gm2379, located in both nucleus and cytoplasm, becomes dramatically upregulated in response to the depletion of m6A or Ythdc1. Consistent with the role of m6A in cell fate regulation, depletion of Gm2379 results in dysregulated expressions of pluripotent genes and crucial genes required for the formation of three germ layers. Collectively, our study provides a foundation for understanding the dynamic regulation of lncRNA transcriptomes during ESC differentiation and identifies the interplay between epitranscriptomic modification and key lncRNAs in the regulation of cell fate decision.",

The production of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from somatic cells provides a means to create valuable tools for basic research and may also produce a source of patient-matched cells for regenerative therapies. iPSCs may be generated using multiple protocols and derived from multiple cell sources. Once generated, iPSCs are tested using a variety of assays including immunostaining for pluripotency markers, generation of three germ layers in embryoid bodies and teratomas, comparisons of gene expression with embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and production of chimeric mice with or without germline contribution2. Importantly, iPSC lines that pass these tests still vary in their capacity to produce different differentiated cell types2. This has made it difficult to establish which iPSC derivation protocols, donor cell sources or selection methods are most useful for different applications. The most stringent test of whether a stem cell line has sufficient developmental potential to generate all tissues required for survival of an organism (termed full pluripotency) is tetraploid embryo complementation (TEC)3-5. Technically, TEC involves electrofusion of two-cell embryos to generate tetraploid (4n) one-cell embryos that can be cultured in vitro to the blastocyst stage6. Diploid (2n) pluripotent stem cells (e.g. ESCs or iPSCs) are then injected into the blastocoel cavity of the tetraploid blastocyst and transferred to a recipient female for gestation (see Figure 1). The tetraploid component of the complemented embryo contributes almost exclusively to the extraembryonic tissues (placenta, yolk sac), whereas the diploid cells constitute the embryo proper, resulting in a fetus derived entirely from the injected stem cell line. Recently, we reported the derivation of iPSC lines that reproducibly generate adult mice via TEC1. These iPSC lines give rise to viable pups with efficiencies of 5-13%, which is comparable to ESCs3,4,7 and higher than that reported for most other iPSC lines8-12. These reports show that direct reprogramming can produce fully pluripotent iPSCs that match ESCs in their developmental potential and efficiency of generating pups in TEC tests. At present, it is not clear what distinguishes between fully pluripotent iPSCs and less potent lines13-15. Nor is it clear which reprogramming methods will produce these lines with the highest efficiency. Here we describe one method that produces fully pluripotent iPSCs and \"all- iPSC\" mice, which may be helpful for investigators wishing to compare the pluripotency of iPSC lines or establish the equivalence of different reprogramming methods.",

Simple Summary Increasing evidence has revealed the regulatory roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the initiation and progress of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). As some novel lncRNA-targeted techniques combined with immune checkpoint therapies have emerged, they provide a new strategy for OSCC treatment. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding the involvement of lncRNAs in OSCC along with their possible use as diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and therapeutic targets. Abstract Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a type of malignancy with high mortality, leading to poor prognosis worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying OSCC carcinogenesis have not been fully understood. Recently, the discovery and characterization of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have revealed their regulatory importance in OSCC. Abnormal expression of lncRNAs has been broadly implicated in the initiation and progress of tumors. In this review, we summarize the functions and molecular mechanisms regarding these lncRNAs in OSCC. In addition, we highlight the crosstalk between lncRNA and tumor microenvironment (TME), and discuss the potential applications of lncRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic tools and therapeutic targets in OSCC. Notably, we also discuss lncRNA-targeted therapeutic techniques including CRISPR-Cas9 as well as immune checkpoint therapies to target lncRNA and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Therefore, this review presents the future perspectives of lncRNAs in OSCC therapy, but more research is needed to allow the applications of these findings to the clinic.",

        "abstract": "The application of novel therapeutics, celecoxib-coated microspheres, local administration of IGF-1 and activated chondrocytes following surgical debridement of SBCs hinders the expansion of S BCs and prevents the progression of osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease affecting middle-aged and elderly patients. It mainly involves weight-bearing joints such as the hip, knee and spine as well as the basilar joint of the thumb, causing dysfunction and painful symptoms. Often, joint arthritis is accompanied by cartilage defects, joint space narrowing, osteophytes, bone sclerosis and subchondral bone cysts (SBC). The aim of the present study was to explore the pathophysiology responsible for the development of SBCs as well as the association between SBCs and disease progress, the level of clinical symptoms and their impact on postoperative outcomes and risk of possible complications following joint replacements if left untreated. A literature review on PubMed articles was conducted to retrieve and evaluate all available evidence related to the main objective mentioned above. A few theories have been put forth to explain the formation process of SBCs. These involve MMPs secretion, angiogenesis, and enhanced bone turnover as a biological response to abnormal mechanical loads causing repeated injuries on cartilage and subchondral tissue during the development of arthritis. However, the application of novel therapeutics, celecoxib-coated microspheres, local administration of IGF-1 and activated chondrocytes following surgical debridement of SBCs hinders the expansion of SBCs and prevents the progression of osteoarthritis.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this review is to present the principles of kinetic vitrification, the main findings in the literature, and the perspectives for the utilization of this technique as a cryopreservation method. Abstract Sperm cryopreservation is an important tool for genetic diversity management programs and the conservation of endangered breeds and species. The most widely used method of sperm conservation is slow freezing, however, during the process, sperm cells suffer from cryoinjury, which reduces their viability and fertility rates. One of the alternatives to slow freezing is vitrification, that consist on rapid freezing, in which viable cells undergo glass-like solidification. This technology requires large concentrations of permeable cryoprotectants (P- CPA\u2019s) which increase the viscosity of the medium to prevent intracellular ice formation during cooling and warming, obtaining successful results in vitrification of oocytes and embryos. Unfortunately, this technology failed when applied to vitrification of sperm due to its higher sensitivity to increasing concentrations of P-CPAs. Alternatively, a technique termed \u2018kinetic sperm vitrification\u2019 has been used and consists in a technique of permeant cryoprotectant-free cryopreservation by direct plunging of a sperm suspension into liquid nitrogen. Some of the advantages of kinetic vitrification are the speed of execution and no rate-controlled equipment required. This technique has been used successfully and with better results for motility in human (50-70% motility recovery), dog (42%), fish (82%) and donkey (21.7%). However, more studies are required to improve sperm viability after devitrification, especially when it comes to motility recovery. The objective of this review is to present the principles of kinetic vitrification, the main findings in the literature, and the perspectives for the utilization of this technique as a cryopreservation method.",

        "abstract": "The current status of and perspectives on dECM-based bioinks for bioprinting in tissue engineering are discussed and the various biopprinting techniques and decellularization methods were discussed in this study. In recent years, three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting has been widely utilized as a novel manufacturing technique by more and more researchers to construct various tissue substitutes with complex architectures and geometries. Different biomaterials, including natural and synthetic materials, have been manufactured into bioinks for tissue regeneration using 3D bioprinting. Among the natural biomaterials derived from various natural tissues or organs, the decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) has a complex internal structure and a variety of bioactive factors that provide mechanistic, biophysical, and biochemical signals for tissue regeneration and remodeling. In recent years, more and more researchers have been developing the dECM as a novel bioink for the construction of tissue substitutes. Compared with other bioinks, the various ECM components in dECM-based bioink can regulate cellular functions, modulate the tissue regeneration process, and adjust tissue remodeling. Therefore, we conducted this review to discuss the current status of and perspectives on dECM-based bioinks for bioprinting in tissue engineering. In addition, the various bioprinting techniques and decellularization methods were also discussed in this study.",

The epicardium is a multipotent cell layer that is vital to myocardial development and regeneration. Epicardial cells contribute to cardiac fibroblast and smooth muscle populations of the heart and secrete paracrine factors that promote cardiomyocyte proliferation and angiogenesis. Despite a central role in cardiac biology, the mechanisms by which epicardial cells influence cardiac growth are largely unknown, and robust models of the epicardium are needed. Here, we review our protocol for differentiating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into epicardial-like cells through temporal modulation of canonical Wnt signaling. iPSC-derived epicardial cells (iECs) resemble in vivo epicardial cells morphologically and display markers characteristic of the developing epicardium. We also review our protocol for differentiating iECs into fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells through treatment with bFGF and TGF-\u03b21, respectively. iECs provide a platform for studying fundamental epicardial biology and can inform strategies for therapeutic heart regeneration.",

To date, hepatocytes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) provide a potentially unlimited resource for clinical application and drug development. However, most hiPSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells initiated differentiation from highly purified definitive endoderm, which are insufficient to accurately replicate the complex regulation of signals among multiple cells and tissues during liver organogenesis, thereby displaying an immature phenotypic and short survival time in vitro. Here, we described a protocol to achieve codifferentiation of endoderm-derived hepatocytes and mesoderm-derived nonparenchymal cells by the inclusion of BMP4 into hepatic differentiation medium, which has a beneficial effect on the hepatocyte maturation and lifespan in vitro. Our codifferentiation system suggests the important role of nonparenchymal cells in liver organogenesis. Hopefully, these hepatocytes described here provide a promising approach in the therapy of liver diseases.",

        "abstract": "It is demonstrated that ATE, when added as cell culture supplement, effectively induced triglyceride accumulation in human adipose stem cells at concentrations from 200\u2009\u03bcg/mL upward in less than a week and caused elevated levels of adipocyte differentiation markers when treated with ATE. The induction of adequate vascularization, a major challenge in tissue engineering, has been tried with numerous methods but with unsatisfactory results. Adipose tissue, an active endocrine organ with dense vasculature, secretes a wide number of angiogenic and adipogenic factors and seems an attractive source for these bioactive factors. We produced a novel cell-free extract from mature human adipose tissue (adipose tissue extract [ATE]) and analyzed the ability of this extract to induce angiogenesis and adipogenesis in vitro and studied the cytokine and growth factor composition of ATE with ELISA and cytokine array. We demonstrate that ATE, when added as cell culture supplement, effectively induced triglyceride accumulation in human adipose stem cells at concentrations from 200\u2009\u03bcg/mL upward in less than a week and caused elevated levels of adipocyte differentiation markers (proliferator-activated receptor gamma and acyl-CoA-binding protein) when treated with at least 350\u2009\u03bcg/mL of ATE. ATE induced angiogenesis from 450\u2009\u03bcg/mL upward after a week in vitro. ATE contained numerous angiogenic and adipogenic factors, for example, vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, interleukin-6, adiponectin, angiogenin, leptin, and insulin-like growth factor-I, as well as lower levels of a wide variety of other cytokines. We here present a novel cell-free angiogenesis- and adipogenesis-inducing agent that is cell-free and easy to produce, and its effect is dose dependent and its composition can be easily modified. Therefore, ATE is a promising novel agent to be used for angiogenesis induction to overcome the challenge of vascularization and for adipogenesis induction in a wide variety of tissue engineering applications in vitro and in vivo. ATE is also efficient for reproduction and modeling of natural adipogenesis in vitro for, for example, obesity and diabetes studies.",

        "abstract": "Results suggested that RECQL4 was overexpressed in HCC tissues and cell lines, which was related to poor prognosis of HCC patients, and SRSF1 can bind toRECQL4 mRNA and enhance its stability, thereby promoting the progression of H CC. ABSTRACT Abnormally high expression of RecQ protein-like 4 (RECQL4) has been observed in many cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to explore the effects of RECQL4 on HCC progression and the possible mechanisms. RECQL4 expression in HCC tissues and its correlation with the prognosis of HCC patients were analyzed using GEPIA2 and UALCAN databases. After detecting RECQL4 levels in several human HC cell lines, RECQL4 was silenced by siRNA transfection. Cell viability, migration and invasion were tested with CCK-8, wound healing and transwell assays. The levels of epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) proteins were evaluated by western blotting. The ENCORI database was adopted for the analysis of the correlation between RECQL4 and serine/arginine splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) in HCC tissues. RNA immunoprecipitation and actinomycin D addition assay were employed to evaluate the combination of these two genes. SRSF1 was overexpressed to assess the biological function of HCC cells with RECQL4 silencing. Results suggested that RECQL4 was overexpressed in HCC tissues and cell lines, which was related to poor prognosis of HCC patients. RECQL4 loss-of-function repressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT of HCC cells. RECQL4 was positively correlated with SRSF1 in HCC tissues. Moreover, SRSF1 was confirmed as an RNA binding protein of RECQL4. Further experiments found that SRSF1 knockdown reduced the stability of RECQL4 mRNA. Rescue assays indicated that SRSF1 overexpression crippled the braking effects of RECQL4 knockdown on the progression of HCC cells. Collectively, SRSF1 can bind to RECQL4 mRNA and enhance its stability, thereby promoting the progression of HCC.",

        "abstract": "In this study, sheep somatic cells were reprogrammed in vitro into sheep iPSCs with stable morphology, pluripotent marker expression, and differentiation ability, delivered by piggyBac transposon system with eight doxycycline-inducible exogenous reprogramming factors. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have the potential to differentiate to all cell types of an adult individual and are useful for studying mammalian development. Establishing induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) capable of expressing pluripotent genes and differentiating to three germ layers will not only help to explain the mechanisms underlying somatic reprogramming but also lay the foundation for the establishment of sheep embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in vitro. In this study, sheep somatic cells were reprogrammed in vitro into sheep iPSCs with stable morphology, pluripotent marker expression, and differentiation ability, delivered by piggyBac transposon system with eight doxycycline (DOX)-inducible exogenous reprogramming factors: bovine OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, cMYC, porcine NANOG, human LIN28, SV40 large T antigen, and human TERT. Sheep iPSCs exhibited a chimeric contribution to the early blastocysts of sheep and mice and E6.5 mouse embryos in vitro. A transcriptome analysis revealed the pluripotent characteristics of somatic reprogramming and insights into sheep iPSCs. This study provides an ideal experimental material for further study of the construction of totipotent ESCs in sheep.",

        "abstract": "The HLA-G-related immunosuppressive property of HUCMSCs, which is more potent than MSCs of other origin, is confirmed and a good tolerance of this mesenchymal stem cell in allogeneic transplantation can thus be anticipated. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and especially those derived from fetal tissues exert a potent immunosuppressive effect that can be enhanced under inflammatory conditions. This study aimed to explore the immunosuppressive properties of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HUCMSCs). We found that HLA-G, the nonclassical HLA allele with strong immune-inhibitory properties, was much more expressed on the HUCMSCs than on MSCs of other origins. Flow cytometry revealed that 90.8% of the HUCMSCs expressed HLA-G. RT-PCR revealed expression of HLA-G1, HLA-G5, and HLA-G7 in all of four HUCMSC lines. In a mixed lymphocyte reaction assay, the HUCMSCs inhibited the proliferation of lymphocytes by 35 \u00b1 3% and could be reversed by treatment with an HLA-G blocking antibody. Upon coculture with the HUCMSCs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells expressed lower levels of proinflammatory mediators such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and VEGF-\u03b1. This immunosuppressive effect was enhanced when the HUCMSCs were pretreated with IFN-\u03b3, such that the expression of HLA-G was highly activated and HLA-DR diminished. The same phenomenon was not observed in MSCs derived from bone marrow or the placenta. In a xenograft rejection assay, the HUCMSCs survived in immunocompetent mice, whereas primary fibroblasts did not survive. This study confirms the HLA-G-related immunosuppressive property of HUCMSCs, which is more potent than MSCs of other origin. A good tolerance of this mesenchymal stem cell in allogeneic transplantation can thus be anticipated.",

        "abstract": "The current understanding in biomechanical microenvironment homeostasis associated with peripheral nerve function and PNR is integrated, and the importance of balances of mechanosensitive elements, cytoskeletal structures, mechanotransduction cascades, and extracellular matrix components is proposed. Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) caused by trauma, chronic disease and other factors may lead to partial or complete loss of sensory, motor and autonomic functions, as well as neuropathic pain. Biological activities are always accompanied by mechanical stimulation, and biomechanical microenvironmental homeostasis plays a complicated role in tissue repair and regeneration. Recent studies have focused on the effects of biomechanical microenvironment on peripheral nervous system development and function maintenance, as well as neural regrowth following PNI. For example, biomechanical factors-induced cluster gene expression changes contribute to formation of peripheral nerve structure and maintenance of physiological function. In addition, extracellular matrix and cell responses to biomechanical microenvironment alterations after PNI directly trigger a series of cascades for the well-organized peripheral nerve regeneration (PNR) process, where cell adhesion molecules, cytoskeletons and mechanically gated ion channels serve as mechanosensitive units, mechanical effector including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) as mechanotransduction elements. With the rapid development of tissue engineering techniques, a substantial number of PNR strategies such as aligned nerve guidance conduits, three-dimensional topological designs and piezoelectric scaffolds emerge expected to improve the neural biomechanical microenvironment in case of PNI. These tissue engineering nerve grafts display optimized mechanical properties and outstanding mechanomodulatory effects, but a few bottlenecks restrict their application scenes. In this review, the current understanding in biomechanical microenvironment homeostasis associated with peripheral nerve function and PNR is integrated, where we proposed the importance of balances of mechanosensitive elements, cytoskeletal structures, mechanotransduction cascades, and extracellular matrix components; a wide variety of promising tissue engineering strategies based on biomechanical modulation are introduced with some suggestions and prospects for future directions.",

There exists a worldwide shortage of donor livers available for orthotropic liver transplantation and hepatocyte transplantation therapies. In addition to their therapeutic potential, primary human hepatocytes facilitate the study of molecular and genetic aspects of human hepatic disease and development and provide a platform for drug toxicity screens and identification of novel pharmaceuticals with potential to treat a wide array of metabolic diseases. The demand for human hepatocytes, therefore, heavily outweighs their availability. As an alternative to using donor livers as a source of primary hepatocytes, we explored the possibility of generating patient\u2010specific human hepatocytes from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Conclusion: We demonstrate that mouse iPS cells retain full potential for fetal liver development and describe a procedure that facilitates the efficient generation of highly differentiated human hepatocyte\u2010like cells from iPS cells that display key liver functions and can integrate into the hepatic parenchyma in vivo.

        "abstract": "Results reveal inconsistencies in the data annotations as well as ambiguities in the emotional states expressed, contributing to a more in-depth understanding of previous emotion recognition approaches, and improving the design of more transparent AI solutions. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based emotion recognition using various kinds of data has attracted vast attention in recent years. Impressive results have been achieved, but only recently the influence of the training data with its potential biases and variations in annotation quality are discussed. Still, the majority of the research literature focuses on improving machine learning techniques and model performance using single data sets. Literature on the impact of training data remains scarce. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the influence of the training data on the accuracy of recognizing emotional states in facial expressions by a comparative evaluation, using multiple established facial image databases. Results reveal inconsistencies in the data annotations as well as ambiguities in the emotional states expressed. Thus, they allow to critically discuss data quality of the training data, contributing to a more in-depth understanding of previous emotion recognition approaches, and improving the design of more transparent AI solutions.",

        "title": "Tolerance to paternal genotoxic damage promotes survival during embryo development in zebrafish (Danio rerio)",
        "abstract": "In fish embryos, genomic instability generated by fertilization with DNA damaged sperm activates mechanisms of DNA damage tolerance, which seems to be mediated by \u0394113p53 expression, promoting survival. ABSTRACT Spermatozoa carry DNA damage that must be repaired by the oocyte machinery upon fertilization. Different strategies could be adopted by different vertebrates to face the paternal genotoxic damage. Mammals have strong sperm selection mechanisms and activate a zygotic DNA damage response (DDR) (including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and alternative apoptosis) in order to guarantee the genomic conformity of the reduced progeny. However, external fertilizers, with different reproductive strategies, seem to proceed distinctively. Previous results from our group showed a downregulation of apoptotic activity in trout embryos with a defective DNA repairing ability, suggesting that mechanisms of tolerance to damaged DNA could be activated in fish to maintain cell survival and to progress with development. In this work, zebrafish embryos were obtained from control or UV-irradiated sperm (carrying more than 10% of fragmented DNA but still preserving fertilization ability). DNA repair (\u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 foci), apoptotic activity, expression of genes related to DDR and malformation rates were analyzed throughout development. Results showed in the progeny from damaged sperm, an enhanced repairing activity at the mid-blastula transition stage that returned to its basal level at later stages, rendering at hatching a very high rate of multimalformed larvae. The study of transcriptional and post-translational activity of tp53 (ZDF-GENE-990415-270) revealed the activation of an intense DDR in those progenies. However, the downstream pro-apoptotic factor noxa (ZDF-GENE-070119-3) showed a significant downregulation, whereas the anti-apoptotic gene bcl2 (ZDF-GENE-051015-1) was upregulated, triggering a repressive apoptotic scenario in spite of a clear genomic instability. This repression can be explained by the observed upregulation of p53 isoform \u0394113p53, which is known to enhance bcl2 transcription. Our results showed that tp53 is involved in DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathways, allowing the embryo survival regardless of the paternal DNA damage. DDT could be an evolutionary mechanism in fish: tolerance to unrepaired sperm DNA could introduce new mutations, some of them potentially advantageous to face a changing environment. Summary: In fish embryos, genomic instability generated by fertilization with DNA damaged sperm activates mechanisms of DNA damage tolerance, which seems to be mediated by \u0394113p53 expression, promoting survival.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this review is to summarize the pathophysiological role of immune dysregulation in various organ systems of PCOS patients and provide new ideas for systemic treatment of PCos in the future. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common reproductive endocrine disorder affecting women, which can lead to infertility. Infertility, obesity, hirsutism, acne, and irregular menstruation are just a few of the issues that PCOS can be linked to. PCOS has a complicated pathophysiology and a range of clinical symptoms. Chronic low-grade inflammation is one of the features of PCOS. The inflammatory environment involves immune and metabolic disturbances. Numerous organ systems across the body, in addition to the female reproductive system, have been affected by the pathogenic role of immunological dysregulation in PCOS in recent years. Insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism are associated with immune cell dysfunction and cytokine imbalance. More importantly, obesity is also involved in immune dysfunction in PCOS, leading to an inflammatory environment in women with PCOS. Hormone, obesity, and metabolic interactions contribute to the pathogenesis of PCOS. Hormone imbalance may also contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases. The aim of this review is to summarize the pathophysiological role of immune dysregulation in various organ systems of PCOS patients and provide new ideas for systemic treatment of PCOS in the future.",

Long noncoding (lnc)RNAs have recently emerged as key regulators of gene expression. Here, we performed high-depth poly(A)+ RNA sequencing across multiple clonal populations of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to comprehensively identify differentially regulated lncRNAs. We establish a biologically robust profile of lncRNA expression in these two cell types and further confirm that the majority of these lncRNAs are enriched in the nucleus. Applying weighted gene coexpression network analysis, we define a group of lncRNAs that are tightly associated with the pluripotent state of ESCs. Among these, we show that acute depletion of Platr14 using antisense oligonucleotides impacts the differentiation- and development-associated gene expression program of ESCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Firre, a lncRNA highly enriched in the nucleoplasm and previously reported to mediate chromosomal contacts in ESCs, controls a network of genes related to RNA processing. Together, we provide a comprehensive, up-to-date, and high resolution compilation of lncRNA expression in ESCs and NPCs and show that nuclear lncRNAs are tightly integrated into the regulation of ESC gene expression.",

        "abstract": "There is great potential in iPSC technology and what can be achieved in consumerism, animal welfare, and environmental protection and conservation. Stem cells are unique cell populations able to copy themselves exactly as well as specialize into new cell types. Stem cells isolated from early stages of embryo development are pluripotent, i.e., can be differentiated into multiple different cell types. In addition, scientists have found a way of reverting specialized cells from an adult into an embryonic\u2010like state. These cells, that are as effective as cells isolated from early embryos, are termed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The potency of iPSC technology is recently being employed by researchers aimed at helping wildlife and environmental conservation efforts. Ambitious attempts using iPSCs are being made to preserve endangered animals as well as reanimate extinct species, merging science fiction with reality. Other research to sustain natural resources and promote animal welfare are exploring iPSCs for laboratory grown animal products without harm to animals offering unorthodox options for creating meat, leather, and fur. There is great potential in iPSC technology and what can be achieved in consumerism, animal welfare, and environmental protection and conservation. Here, we discuss current research in the field of iPSCs and how these research groups are attempting to achieve their goals. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2019;8:7\u201313",

        "abstract": "The present review demonstrates the current knowledge that all potential lncRNA expression signatures are molecular biomarkers for the early prediction of prognosis in OSCC. Simple Summary Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) ranks as one of the deadliest cancers in India. Only early detection of the disease with specific prognostic subtype, is the key to reducing OSCC related death. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are master regulator of almost all biological processes. Evidences have shown that the aberrant expression of lncRNAs are found to exceed their role in different pathophysiological conditions including OSCC. The distinct expression profile of dysregulated lncRNAs in circulation could be a potential indicator to predict the OSCC-disease prognostications. The present review demonstrates that these aberrant expression of circulating lncRNAs may become powerful information regarding the blood-based biomarkers for the early prediction of disease-prognosis in OSCC. The present review also demonstrates clinical significance, limitations and challenges of circulating lncRNAs to be a potential reliable biomarker for the development of liquid biopsy technique which will be very useful, rapid, easy for clinicians for prognosis, disease monitoring, and clinical decision making to manage the treatment modality accurately in OSCC. Abstract Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) have little or no coding potential. These transcripts are longer than 200 nucleotides. Since lncRNAs are master regulators of almost all biological processes, recent evidence proves that aberrantly expressed lncRNAs are pathogenic for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and other diseases. LncRNAs influence chromatin modifications, transcriptional modifications, post-transcriptional modifications, genomic imprinting, cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and apoptosis. Consequently, they have an impact on the disease transformation, progression, and morbidity in OSCC. Therefore, circulating lncRNAs could be the potential cancer biomarker for the better clinical management (diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring) of OSCC to provide advanced treatment strategies and clinical decisions. In this review, we report and discuss the recent understandings and perceptions of dysregulated lncRNAs with a focus on their clinical significance in OSCC-disease monitoring and treatment. Evidence clearly indicates that a specific lncRNA expression signature could act as an indicator for the early prediction of diagnosis and prognosis for the initiation, progression, recurrence, metastasis and other clinical prognostic-factors (overall survival, disease-free survival, etc.) in OSCC. The present review demonstrates the current knowledge that all potential lncRNA expression signatures are molecular biomarkers for the early prediction of prognosis in OSCC. Finally, the review provides information about the clinical significance, challenges and limitations of the clinical usage of circulating lncRNAs in a liquid biopsy method in early, pre-symptomatic, sub-clinical, accurate OSCC prognostication. More studies on lncRNA are required to unveil the biology of the inherent mechanisms involved in the process of the development of differential prognostic outcomes in OSCC.",

        "abstract": "The potential impact of single-cell sequencing on understanding cancer biology and how it could eventually benefit a clinical setting is explored, and the techniques and experimental approaches which made this technology possible are explored. Simple Summary Cancer is a distinctly difficult disease to treat on account of the diverse cell populations/subpopulations that comprise a tumour. Such cells harbour varying genetic and epigenetic states, which contributes to their oncogenic phenotype. Of note to this review is the epigenetic modification DNA methylation. Aberrant DNA methylation is a well-explored contributor to oncogenic phenotype. Traditionally, thousands of cells within a tumour have been sequenced together, giving rise to averaged methylation profiles. With the emergence of single-cell sequencing technologies, the methylome of individual cells can now be acquired. This technology will have important research and clinical implications, such as informing our current understanding of cancer biology, discovery of novel biomarkers, and less invasive tests. Abstract Morphological, transcriptomic, and genomic defects are well-explored parameters of cancer biology. In more recent years, the impact of epigenetic influences, such as DNA methylation, is becoming more appreciated. Aberrant DNA methylation has been implicated in many types of cancers, influencing cell type, state, transcriptional regulation, and genomic stability to name a few. Traditionally, large populations of cells from the tissue of interest are coalesced for analysis, producing averaged methylome data. Considering the inherent heterogeneity of cancer, analysing populations of cells as a whole denies the ability to discover novel aberrant methylation patterns, identify subpopulations, and trace cell lineages. Due to recent advancements in technology, it is now possible to obtain methylome data from single cells. This has both research and clinical implications, ranging from the identification of biomarkers to improved diagnostic tools. As with all emerging technologies, distinct experimental, bioinformatic, and practical challenges present themselves. This review begins with exploring the potential impact of single-cell sequencing on understanding cancer biology and how it could eventually benefit a clinical setting. Following this, the techniques and experimental approaches which made this technology possible are explored. Finally, the present challenges currently associated with single-cell DNA methylation sequencing are described.",

        "abstract": "The current review aims at summarization the role of miR-424 in the process of cancer evolution and its impact on clinical outcome of patients in order to find appropriate markers for malignancies. Recent studies have revealed the impact of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the carcinogenic process. miR-424 is a miRNA whose role in this process is being to be identified. Experiments in the ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, neuroblastoma, breast cancer, osteosarcoma, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, hemangioma and gastric cancer have reported down-regulation of miR-424. On the other hand, this miRNA has been found to be up-regulated in melanoma, laryngeal and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, glioma, multiple myeloma and thyroid cancer. Expression of this miRNA is regulated by methylation status of its promoter. Besides, LINC00641, CCAT2, PVT1, LIN00657, LINC00511 and NNT-AS1 are among lncRNAs that act as molecular sponges for miR-424, thus regulating its expression. Moreover, several members of SNHG family of lncRNAs have been found to regulate expression of miR-424. This miRNA is also involved in the regulation of E2F transcription factors. The current review aims at summarization of the role of miR-424 in the process of cancer evolution and its impact on clinical outcome of patients in order to find appropriate markers for malignancies.",

        "abstract": "Results suggest that IMRCs are ready for clinical trials on lung disorders, and are superior to both primary UCMSCs and the FDA-approved drug pirfenidone, with an excellent efficacy and safety profile in mice and monkeys. Lung injury and fibrosis represent the most significant outcomes of severe and acute lung disorders, including COVID-19. However, there are still no effective drugs to treat lung injury and fibrosis. In this study, we report the generation of clinical-grade human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-derived immunity- and matrix-regulatory cells (IMRCs) produced under good manufacturing practice requirements, that can treat lung injury and fibrosis in vivo. We generate IMRCs by sequentially differentiating hESCs with serum-free reagents. IMRCs possess a unique gene expression profile distinct from that of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs), such as higher expression levels of proliferative, immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic genes. Moreover, intravenous delivery of IMRCs inhibits both pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mouse models of lung injury, and significantly improves the survival rate of the recipient mice in a dose-dependent manner, likely through paracrine regulatory mechanisms. IMRCs are superior to both primary UCMSCs and the FDA-approved drug pirfenidone, with an excellent efficacy and safety profile in mice and monkeys. In light of public health crises involving pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, our findings suggest that IMRCs are ready for clinical trials on lung disorders.",

        "abstract": "This review focuses on methods to reprogram somatic cells into hiPSC and the solutions for overcome immaturity of thehiPSC-derived-CMs to mimic the structure and physiological properties of the adult human CMs to accurately model disease and test drug safety. A comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology and cellular responses to drugs in human heart disease is limited by species differences between humans and experimental animals. In addition, isolation of human cardiomyocytes (CMs) is complicated because cells obtained by biopsy do not proliferate to provide sufficient numbers of cells for preclinical studies in vitro. Interestingly, the discovery of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) has opened up the possibility of generating and studying heart disease in a culture dish. The combination of reprogramming and genome editing technologies to generate a broad spectrum of human heart diseases in vitro offers a great opportunity to elucidate gene function and mechanisms. However, to exploit the potential applications of hiPSC-derived-CMs for drug testing and studying adult-onset cardiac disease, a full functional characterization of maturation and metabolic traits is required. In this review, we focus on methods to reprogram somatic cells into hiPSC and the solutions for overcome immaturity of the hiPSC-derived-CMs to mimic the structure and physiological properties of the adult human CMs to accurately model disease and test drug safety. Finally, we discuss how to improve the culture, differentiation, and purification of CMs to obtain sufficient numbers of desired types of hiPSC-derived-CMs for disease modeling and drug development platform.",

        "abstract": "Results showed that ASCs derived from adipose explants can differentiate along multiple lineages in vitro and in vivo and suggested that SFAE has beneficial influence on adipogenesis and angiogenesis both in vitroand in vivo. Adipogenic differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) is known to be affected by many promoting and inhibiting factors, and correlated with surrounding cells and extracellular matrix. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of secreted biological molecules from adipose tissue explants on the growth of ASCs. In this study, ASCs were isolated and the secretory factors from adipose tissue explants (SFAE) were prepared from adipose tissue explants. The multilineage differentiation potential of ASCs was determined using different inductive media. The influence of SFAE on the colony formation and proliferation of ASCs was determined using colony-forming efficiency assay and Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, respectively. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were performed to analyze the beneficial effect of SFAE on the adipogenesis and angiogenesis of ASCs. Utilizing gelatin scaffold, the influence of SFAE on ASCs was investigated in vivo. Subsequently, cell/gelatin constructs were cultured in a subcutaneous pocket on a rat dorsum for 2 and 9 weeks, and the resultant samples were histologically evaluated. Results showed that ASCs derived from adipose explants can differentiate along multiple lineages in vitro. Utilizing SFAE, the proliferation and colony-forming efficiency of ASCs were inhibited, while the expression of adipogenesis markers such as C/EBP\u03b2, PPAR\u03b32, and LPL, as well as angiogenesis factor VEGF-A were promoted. Moreover, the beneficial effect of SFAE on adipogenesis was revealed in vivo. In conclusion, our results suggested that SFAE has beneficial influence on adipogenesis and angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo.",

        "abstract": "The authors' immunohistochemical results suggest an active role of SRSF1 in inducing a local recurrence of BCCs; however, further studies are needed to validate the findings. Background and Objectives: Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are the most frequent skin tumors; although they usually exhibit a good prognosis, it has been reported that there is a 2\u20138% rate of local recurrence of surgically-excised BCCs, even in the presence of tumor-free surgical margins. Several histological and clinical risk factors have been associated with a higher risk of local relapse; however, the exact pathogenetic mechanisms that regulate the local recurrence of these tumors are still to be elucidated. The serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) is an RNA-binding protein whose oncogenic function has been described in numerous forms of human cancers, including brain, lung, and prostate tumors. We evaluated the correlation between SRSF1 immunoexpression and the local recurrence of BCCs. Materials and Methods: Fifty-two cases of surgically excised BCCs with free-tumor margins (10 high-risk and 42 low-risk variants), for which follow-up data were available, were selected. Local recurrence occurred in only 5 cases. Results: We found high and low immunoexpressions of SRSF1 in 18 and 34 cases, respectively. A statistically significant association between high SRSF1 immunoexpression and the local recurrence of BCC was found (p = 0.0433). Conclusions: Our immunohistochemical results suggest an active role of SRSF1 in inducing a local recurrence of BCCs; however, further studies on a larger series are needed to validate our findings.",

        "abstract": "This mini review summarizes the current literature related to the derivation of iPSCs/iPSC-like cells from domesticated ruminants with a focus on reprogramming protocols, characterization, associated limitations, and potential applications in ruminant basic science research and production. Ruminant livestock, including cattle, sheep, goat, and buffalo, are essential for global food security and serve valuable roles in sustainable agricultural systems. With the limited availability of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from these species, ruminant induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-like cells provide a valuable research tool for agricultural, veterinary, biomedical, and pharmaceutical applications, as well as for the prospect of translation to human medicine. iPSCs are generated by reprogramming of adult or fetal cells to an ESC-like state by ectopic expression of defined transcription factors. Despite the slow pace the field has evolved in livestock species compared to mice and humans, significant progress has been made over the past 15 years in using different cell sources and reprogramming protocols to generate iPSCs/iPSC-like cells from ruminants. This mini review summarizes the current literature related to the derivation of iPSCs/iPSC-like cells from domesticated ruminants with a focus on reprogramming protocols, characterization, associated limitations, and potential applications in ruminant basic science research and production.",

        "abstract": "Considering their chondro-regenerative potential and their retained immunosuppressive capacity, MSC constitute promising allogenic sources of stem cells for cartilage repair. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have emerged as alternative sources of stem cells for regenerative medicine because of their multipotency and strong immune-regulatory properties. Also, human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) is an important mediator of MSC-mediated immunomodulation. However, it is unclear whether MSC retain their immune-privileged potential after differentiation. As promising candidates for cartilage tissue engineering, the immunogenic and immunomodulatory properties of chondro-differentiated MSC (chondro-MSC) require in-depth exploration. In the present study, we used the alginate/hyaluronic acid (Alg/HA) hydrogel scaffold and induced both bone marrow- and adipose tissue-derived MSC into chondrocytes in three-dimensional condition. Then, MSC before and after chondrocyte differentiation were treated or not with interferon \u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 mimicking inflammatory conditions and were compared side by side using flow cytometry, mixed lymphocyte reaction, and immunostaining assays. Results showed that chondro-MSC were hypoimmunogenic and could exert immunosuppression on HLA-mismatched peripheral blood mononuclear cells as well as undifferentiated MSC did. This alloproliferation inhibition mediated by MSC or chondro-MSC was dose dependent. Meanwhile, chondro-MSC exerted inhibition on natural killer cell-mediated cytolysis. Also, we showed that HLA-G expression was upregulated in chondro-MSC under hypoxia context and could be boosted in allogenic settings. Besides, the Alg/HA hydrogel scaffold was hypoimmunogenic and its addition for supporting MSC chondrocyte differentiation did not modify the immune properties of MSC. Finally, considering their chondro-regenerative potential and their retained immunosuppressive capacity, MSC constitute promising allogenic sources of stem cells for cartilage repair.",

        "abstract": "The forefront of regenerative medicine applications using human iPS cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells, shown to have therapeutic effects using various liver injury model mice are introduced. Liver transplantation and hepatocyte transplantation are effective treatments for severe liver injuries, but the donor shortage is a serious problem. Therefore, hepatocyte-like cells generated from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells with unlimited proliferative ability are expected to be a promising new transplantation resource. The technology for hepatic differentiation from human iPS cells has made great progress in this decade. The efficiency of hepatic differentiation now exceeds 90%, making it possible to produce nearly homogeneous hepatocyte-like cells from human iPS cells. Because there is little contamination of undifferentiated cells, there is a lower risk of teratoma formation. To date, the transplantation of human iPS cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells has been shown to have therapeutic effects using various liver injury model mice. Currently, studies are underway using model animals larger than mice. The day when human iPS cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells can be used as cellular medicine is surely approaching. In this review, we introduce the forefront of regenerative medicine applications using human iPS cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells.",

        "abstract": "This study is the first complex analysis of the DNA damage response in endangered sturgeons and indicates a correlation between phenotype formation and changes in transcriptomic and proteomic profiles. \n DNA damage during early life stages may have a negative effect on embryo development, inducing malformations that have long-lasting effects during adult life. Therefore, in the current study, we analyzed the effect of DNA damage induced by genotoxicants (camptothecin (CPT) and olaparib) at different stages of embryo development. We analyzed the survival, DNA fragmentation, transcriptome, and proteome of the endangered sturgeon Acipenser ruthenus. Sturgeons are non-model fish species that can provide new insights into the DNA damage response and embryo development. The transcriptomic and proteomic patterns changed significantly after exposure to genotoxicants in a stage-dependent manner. The results of this study indicate a correlation between phenotype formation and changes in transcriptomic and proteomic profiles. CPT and olaparib downregulated oxidative phosphorylation and metabolic pathways, and upregulated pathways involved in nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and homologous recombination. We observed the upregulated expression of zona pellucida sperm-binding proteins in all treatment groups, as well as the upregulation of several glycolytic enzymes. The analysis of gene expression revealed several markers of DNA damage response and adaptive stress-response, which could be applied in toxicological studies on fish embryo. This study is the first complex analysis of the DNA damage response in endangered sturgeons.",

        "abstract": "The pathophysiological roles of chronic low\u2010grade inflammation mediators including inflammasome\u2010related cytokines, interleukin\u20101 \u03b2 (IL\u20101\u03b2), and IL\u201018 in PCOS development are discussed. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common hormonal imbalance disease in reproductive\u2010aged women. Its basic characteristics are ovulatory dysfunction and ovarian overproduction of androgens that lead to severe symptoms such as insulin resistance, hirsutism, infertility, and acne. Notwithstanding the disease burden, its underlying mechanisms remain unknown, and no causal therapeutic exists. In recent years, further studies showed that inflammation processes are involved in ovulation and play a key role in ovarian follicular dynamics. Visceral adipose tissue can cause inflammatory response and maintenance of the inflammation state in adipocytes by augmented production of inflammatory cytokines, monocyte chemoattractant proteins, and recruitment of the immune cell. Therefore, the PCOS can be related to a low\u2010grade inflammation state and inflammatory markers. Investigating the inflammatory processes and mediators that contribute to the commencement and development of PCOS can be a critical step for better understanding the pathophysiology of the disease and its treatment through inhibition or control of related pathways. In the present review, we discuss the pathophysiological roles of chronic low\u2010grade inflammation mediators including inflammasome\u2010related cytokines, interleukin\u20101\u03b2 (IL\u20101\u03b2), and IL\u201018 in PCOS development.",

        "abstract": "Results indicate that lnc RNA\u20101 represents a new regulatory RNA that plays a relevant role during the early stages of osteogenesis, and knockdown of lncRNA\u20101 expression in primary mouse preosteoblasts was found to inhibit osteogenic differentiation. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a heterogeneous class of transcripts, longer than 200 nucleotides, 5\u2032\u2010capped, polyadenylated, and poorly conserved among mammalian species. Several studies have shown the contribution of lncRNAs to different cellular processes, including regulation of the chromatin structure, control of messenger RNA translation, regulation of gene transcription, regulation of embryonic pluripotency, and differentiation. Although limited numbers of functional lncRNAs have been identified so far, the immense regulatory potential of these RNAs is already evident, indicating that a functional characterization of lncRNAs is needed. In this study, mouse preosteoblastic cells were induced to differentiate into osteoblasts. At 3 sequential differentiation stages, total RNA was isolated and libraries were constructed for Illumina sequencing. The resulting sequences were aligned and transcript abundances were determined. New lncRNA candidates that displayed differential expression patterns during osteoblast differentiation were identified by combining bioinformatics and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses. Among these, lncRNA\u20101 that exhibited increased expression during osteogenesis and was downregulated during myogenesis. Importantly, knockdown of lncRNA\u20101 expression in primary mouse preosteoblasts was found to inhibit osteogenic differentiation, reflected by a reduced transcription of the Runx2/p57 and Sp7 bone master genes. Together, our results indicate that lncRNA\u20101 represents a new regulatory RNA that plays a relevant role during the early stages of osteogenesis.",

Given their tumor-specific and stage-specific gene expression, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have demonstrated to be potential molecular biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response. Particularly, the lncRNAs DSCAM-AS1 and GATA3-AS1 serve as examples of this because of their high subtype-specific expression profile in luminal B-like breast cancer. This makes them candidates to use as molecular biomarkers in clinical practice. However, lncRNA studies in breast cancer are limited in sample size and are restricted to the determination of their biological function, which represents an obstacle for its inclusion as molecular biomarkers of clinical utility. Nevertheless, due to their expression specificity among diseases, such as cancer, and their stability in body fluids, lncRNAs are promising molecular biomarkers that could improve the reliability, sensitivity, and specificity of molecular techniques used in clinical diagnosis. The development of lncRNA-based diagnostics and lncRNA-based therapeutics will be useful in routine medical practice to improve patient clinical management and quality of life.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are frequently dysregulated in human cancers and can act as potent oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Aberrant expression of miR-424 has been identified in some types of cancer, however, its expression and potential biologic role in endometrial cancer are remains to be determined. In the present study, we demonstrated that miR-424 was downregulated in human endometrial cancer and suppressed growth of the human Ishikawa and HEC-1B endometrial cancer cell lines. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that E2F7 was a putative target of miR-424. In a luciferase reporter system, we confirmed that E2F7 was a direct target gene of miR-424. Furthermore, knockdown of E2F7 inhibited Ishikawa and HEC-1B cell growth. These findings indicate that miR-424 targets the E2F7 transcript and suppresses endometrial cancer cell growth, suggesting that miR-424 has a tumor suppressive role in human endometrial cancer pathogenesis.",

        "abstract": "The results show that the cytocompatible crosslinking of dLM bioink at physiological temperatures has promising applications for extended 3D-printing procedures. Bioprinting is an acclaimed technique that allows the scaling of 3D architectures in an organized pattern but suffers from a scarcity of appropriate bioinks. Decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) from xenogeneic species has garnered support as a biomaterial to promote tissue-specific regeneration and repair. The prospect of developing dECM-based 3D artificial tissue is impeded by its inherent low mechanical properties. In recent years, 3D bioprinting of dECM-based bioinks modified with additional scaffolds has advanced the development of load-bearing constructs. However, previous attempts using dECM were limited to low-temperature bioprinting, which is not favorable for a longer print duration with cells. Here, we report the development of a multi-material decellularized liver matrix (dLM) bioink reinforced with gelatin and polyethylene glycol to improve rheology, extrudability, and mechanical stability. This shear-thinning bioink facilitated extrusion-based bioprinting at 37 \u00b0C with HepG2 cells into a 3D grid structure with a further enhancement for long-term applications by enzymatic crosslinking with mushroom tyrosinase. The heavily crosslinked structure showed a 16-fold increase in viscosity (2.73 Pa\u2009s\u22121) and a 32-fold increase in storage modulus from the non-crosslinked dLM while retaining high cell viability (85\u201393%) and liver-specific functions. Our results show that the cytocompatible crosslinking of dLM bioink at physiological temperatures has promising applications for extended 3D-printing procedures.",

        "abstract": "The intravenously delivered hESC-IMRCs alleviated proteinuria and kidney injuries of Heymann nephritis, by their immunosuppressive functions through regulatory T cells and IL-10. Background Primary membranous nephropathy (MN) is a kidney-specific autoimmune disease. Human embryonic stem cells-derived immunity-and-matrix regulatory cells (hESC-IMRCs) have immunoregulatory functions. We hypothesized that hESC-IMRCs might have therapeutic effects on MN and be a potential treatment in clinical practice. Methods Rats of Heymann nephritis were injected with sheep anti-rat Fx1A serum. hESC-IMRCs were intravenously administrated upon the detection of proteinuria, with 6\u2009\u00d7\u200910 6 cells (high-dose) or 3\u2009\u00d7\u200910 6 cells (low-dose) in 1\u00a0ml every other day. Splenocytes and IMRCs were co-cultured at different times and ratios. Cell types and cytokines were detected by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results The urinary protein of rats with Heymann nephritis was reduced remarkably to a level comparable to negative controls, in both low-dose (45.6 vs. 282.3\u00a0mg/d, P \u2009<\u20090.001) and high-dose (35.2 vs. 282.3\u00a0mg/d, P \u2009<\u20090.001) hESC-IMRC treatment groups. IgG and C3 deposit, glomerular basement membrane thickness and foot process effacement were alleviated and the reduced podocin was recovered in the kidneys. The proportions of CD4\u2009+\u2009CD25\u2009+\u2009T cells in circulation and spleen were increased, and the circulating level of IL-10 was increased, after IMRC interventions. IL-17 and TNF-\u03b1 were reduced after IMRCs treatments. IL-10 increased remarkably in the co-culture supernatant of lymphocytes and IMRCs at 48\u00a0h with ratio 10:1. Conclusions The intravenously delivered hESC-IMRCs alleviated proteinuria and kidney injuries of Heymann nephritis, by their immunosuppressive functions through regulatory T cells and IL-10. These pre-clinical results indicate that IMRCs worth careful consideration for human trials in the treatment of MN.",

        "abstract": "Human iPSC-derived cardiac myocytes and sympathetic neurons replicated many features of the anatomy and (patho)physiology of these cells, where co-culture preparations behaved in a manner that mimicked key physiological responses seen in other mammalian systems. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) offer an unprecedented opportunity to generate model systems that facilitate a mechanistic understanding of human disease. Current differentiation protocols are capable of generating cardiac myocytes (hiPSC-CM) and sympathetic neurons (hiPSC-SN). However, the ability of hiPSC-derived neurocardiac co-culture systems to replicate the human phenotype in disease modelling is still in its infancy. Here, we adapted current methods for efficient and replicable induction of hiPSC-CM and hiPSC-SN. Expression of cell-type-specific proteins were confirmed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. The utility of healthy hiPSC-CM was tested with pressor agents to develop a model of cardiac hypertrophy. Treatment with angiotensin II (AngII) resulted in: (i) cell and nuclear enlargement, (ii) enhanced fetal gene expression, and (iii) FRET-activated cAMP responses to adrenergic stimulation. AngII or KCl increased intracellular calcium transients in hiPSC-SN. Immunostaining in neurocardiac co-cultures demonstrated anatomical innervation to myocytes, where myocyte cytosolic cAMP responses were enhanced by forskolin compared with monocultures. In conclusion, human iPSC-derived cardiac myocytes and sympathetic neurons replicated many features of the anatomy and (patho)physiology of these cells, where co-culture preparations behaved in a manner that mimicked key physiological responses seen in other mammalian systems.

        "abstract": "A hepatic organoid platform with human cells that can be used to model complex liver diseases, including NASH is developed and gene expression signatures similar to those of liver tissues from patients with NASH are compared. BACKGROUND & AIMS\nThere are few in vitro models for studying the 3-dimensional interactions among different liver cell types during organogenesis or disease development. We aimed to generate hepatic organoids that comprise different parenchymal liver cell types and have structural features of the liver, using human pluripotent stem cells.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe cultured H1 human embryonic stem cells (WA-01, passage 27-40) and induced pluripotent stem cells (GM23338) with a series of chemically defined and serum-free media to induce formation of posterior foregut cells, which were differentiated in 3-dimensions into hepatic endoderm spheroids and stepwise into hepatoblast spheroids. Hepatoblast spheroids were re-seeded in a high-throughput format and induced to form hepatic organoids; development of functional bile canaliculi was imaged live. Levels of albumin and apolipoprotein B were measured in cell culture supernatants using an ELISA. Levels of gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were measured in cholangiocytes. Organoids were incubated with troglitazone for varying periods and bile transport and accumulation were visualized by live-imaging microscopy. Organoids were incubated with oleic and palmitic acid and formation of lipid droplets was visualized by staining. We compared gene expression profiles of organoids incubated with free fatty acids or without. We also compared gene expression profiles between liver tissue samples from patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) vs without. We quantified hepatocyte and cholangiocyte populations in organoids using immunostaining and flow cytometry; cholangiocyte proliferation of cholangiocytes was measured. We compared the bile canaliculi network in the organoids incubated with vs without free fatty acids by live imaging.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCells in organoids differentiated into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, based on the expression of albumin and cytokeratin-7. Hepatocytes were functional, based on secretion of albumin and apolipoprotein B and cytochrome P450 activity; cholangiocytes were functional, based on GGT and ALP activity and proliferative responses to secretin. The organoids organized a functional bile canaliculi system, which was disrupted by cholestasis-inducing drugs such as troglitazone. Organoids incubated with free fatty acids had gene expression signatures similar to those of liver tissues from patients with NASH. Incubation of organoids with free fatty acid-enriched media resulted in structural changes associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, such as decay of bile canaliculi network and ductular reactions.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe developed a hepatic organoid platform with human cells that can be used to model complex liver diseases, including NASH.",

        "abstract": "It is shown for the first time that CM of adipose tissue is a potent inducer of proliferation of ASCs and angiogenesis, with comparable effects with those of stem cell-enriched CM. BackgroundSplit-thickness skin grafting is the gold standard to cover extensive acute and chronic wounds with a well-vascularized wound bed. Although some headway has been made in developing biological agents to speed up healing, there is still no treatment that sufficiently replaces skin grafts to date. The use of secretory factors of adipose tissue may be a feasible approach to developing topical wound applications for faster wound healing. MethodsIn this study, the effect of conditioned media (CMs) of human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), adipocytes, or adipose tissue on human skin cells was evaluated for viability, proliferation, and migration in vitro. Differentiation potential of stem cells treated with CM was monitored by AdipoRed staining and qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Angiogenic potential of human endothelial cells treated with CM was tested via sprouting assay. ResultsThe CM of adipose tissue significantly enhanced ASC proliferation (P < 0.01). Treatment with CM showed no inductive effect on ASC differentiation into adipocytes but, at the same time, significantly induced cell sprouting of endothelial cells (P < 0.001). We show for the first time that CM of adipose tissue is a potent inducer of proliferation of ASCs and angiogenesis, with comparable effects with those of stem cell-enriched CM. ConclusionsWe suggest the use of the secretome of adipose tissue to produce CM for topical application on wounds, rather than working with adipose tissue or including the difficult process of enriching the patients' stem cells in vitro.",

        "abstract": "The immunohistochemical expression of SRSF1 may be a promising diagnostic marker of astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas and its increased expression might allow for excluding entities that often enter into differential diagnosis, such as ependymomas and pilocytic astroCytomas. Simple Summary Gliomas represent a wide group of central nervous system neoplasms, arising from the glial component of the central nervous system. They are generally sub-classified into astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, ependymomas and other rarer subtypes. Apart from morphological and molecular features, there are currently no specific markers for this heterogeneous group of tumors: thus, there is a need to identify more specific and useful markers to distinguish each histological subtype from the others. SRSF1 has been recently characterized as being functionally involved in gliomagenesis and it has been found that SRSF1 is increased in glioma tissues and its increased immunohistochemical expression among adult diffuse astrocytomas is positively correlated with histological grade. The aim of this study is to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of the SRSF1 protein in a series of astrocytic and non-astrocytic adult gliomas, emphasizing its potential use in the differential diagnosis of these neuropathological entities. Abstract Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the immunohistochemical expression and distribution of serine and arginine rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) in a series of 102 cases of both diffuse and circumscribed adult gliomas to establish the potential diagnostic role of this protein in the differential diagnosis of brain tumors. Methods: This retrospective immunohistochemical study included 42 glioblastoma cases, 21 oligodendrogliomas, 15 ependymomas, 15 pilocytic astrocytomas, 5 sub-ependymal giant cell astrocytoma and 4 pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas. Results: Most glioblastoma (81%), oligodendroglioma (71%), sub-ependymal giant cell astrocytoma (80%) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (75%) cases showed strong SRSF1 immunoexpression, while no detectable staining was found in the majority of ependymomas (87% of cases) and pilocytic astrocytomas (67% of cases). Conclusions: The immunohistochemical expression of SRSF1 may be a promising diagnostic marker of astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas and its increased expression might allow for excluding entities that often enter into differential diagnosis, such as ependymomas and pilocytic astrocytomas.",

        "abstract": "These results constitute the first steps in establishing integration and footprint\u2010free iPSC from ruminants and demonstrate the ability to differentiate into directed lineages in vitro. The creation of genetically modified goats provides a powerful approach for improving animal health, enhancing production traits, animal pharming, and for ensuring food safety all of which are high\u2010priority goals for animal agriculture. The availability of goat embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that are characteristically immortal in culture would be of enormous benefit for developing genetically modified animals. As an alternative to long\u2010sought goat ESCs, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) by forced expression of bovine POU5F1, SOX2, MYC, KLF4, LIN\u201028, and NANOG reprogramming factors in combination with a MIR302/367 cluster, delivered by lentiviral vectors. In order to minimize integrations, the reprogramming factor coding sequences were assembled with porcine teschovirus\u20101 2A (P2A) self\u2010cleaving peptides that allowed for tri\u2010cistronic expression from each vector. The lentiviral\u2010transduced cells were cultured on irradiated mouse feeder cells in a semi\u2010defined, serum\u2010free medium containing fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and/or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The resulting goat iPSC exhibit cell and colony morphology typical of human and mouse ESCs\u2014that is, well\u2010defined borders, a high nuclear\u2010to\u2010cytoplasmic ratio, a short cell\u2010cycle interval, alkaline phosphatase expression, and the ability to generate teratomas in vivo. Additionally, these goat iPSC demonstrated the ability to differentiate into directed lineages in vitro. These results constitute the first steps in establishing integration and footprint\u2010free iPSC from ruminants. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 82: 709\u2013721, 2015. \u00a9 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "It is shown that WJ-MSCs remained hypoimmunogenic and retained immunomodulatory properties even when they had undergone chondrocyte differentiation, even in an allogeneic context. Background: Umbilical mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), and especially those derived from Wharton\u2019s jelly (WJ), are a promising engineering tool for tissue repair in an allogeneic context. This is due to their differentiation capacity and immunological properties, like their immunomodulatory potential and paracrine activity. Hence, these cells may be considered an Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP). The purpose of this work was to differentiate MSCs from WJ (WJ-MSCs) into chondrocytes using a scaffold and to evaluate, in vitro, the immunomodulatory capacities of WJ-MSCs in an allogeneic and inflammatory context, mimicked by IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 priming during the chondrogenic differentiation. Methods: Scaffolds were made from hydrogel composed by alginate enriched in hyaluronic acid (Alg/HA). Chondrogenic differentiation, immunological function, phenotype expression, but also secreted soluble factors were the different parameters followed during 28 days of culture. Results: During chondrocyte differentiation, even in an allogeneic context, WJ-MSCs remained unable to establish the immunological synapse or to induce T cell alloproliferation. Moreover, interestingly, paracrine activity and functional immunomodulation were maintained during cell differentiation. Conclusion: These results show that WJ-MSCs remained hypoimmunogenic and retained immunomodulatory properties even when they had undergone chondrocyte differentiation.",

        "abstract": "With features similar to those of primary adult hepatocytes, the iHep-Orgs produced could be considered as a valuable tool for the development and optimization of preclinical and clinical applications. Background: Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes (iHeps) have been shown to have considerable potential in liver diseases, toxicity, and pharmacological studies. However, there is a growing need to obtain iHeps that are truly similar to primary adult hepatocytes in terms of morphological features and functions. We generated such human iHeps, self-assembled as organoids (iHep-Orgs). Methods: iPSC-derived hepatoblasts were self-assembled into spheroids and differentiated into mature hepatocytes modulating final step of differentiation. Results: In about four weeks of culture, the albumin secretion levels and the complete disappearance of \u03b1-fetoprotein from iHep-Orgs suggested the acquisition of a greater degree of maturation than those previously reported. The expression of apical transporters and bile acid secretion evidenced the acquisition of complex hepatocyte polarity as well as the development of a functional and well-defined bile canalicular network confirmed by computational analysis. Activities recorded for CYP450, UGT1A1, and alcohol dehydrogenase, response to hormonal stimulation, and glucose metabolism were also remarkable. Finally, iHep-Orgs displayed a considerable ability to detoxify pathological concentrations of lactate and ammonia. Conclusions: With features similar to those of primary adult hepatocytes, the iHep-Orgs thus produced could be considered as a valuable tool for the development and optimization of preclinical and clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "A novel enhanced seagull optimization with transfer learning based FER (ESGOTL-FER) model that aims to detect the face and identify the emotions accurately and automatically and the control of the proposed technique over the other existing approaches interms of several performance measures is stated. Emotions create an innate and significant aspect of human behavior that colours the way of human communication. Automated emotion recognition related to facial expression becomes an interesting research domain that can be applied and presented in numerous areas like health, safety, and human-machine interfaces. Research scholars in this domain were concerned with formulating methods for interpreting, coding facial expressions, and extracting such features to have a superior forecast by computer. The analysis of human face characteristics and the recognition of their emotional conditions are very difficult tasks. With the outstanding success of deep learning (DL), various kinds of infrastructures of this method were used for obtaining superior performance. The main aim of this study was to create study on existing works on automatic facial emotion recognition (FER) through DL. In this aspect, this paper projects a novel enhanced seagull optimization with transfer learning based FER (ESGOTL-FER) model. The proposed ESGOTL-FER technique aims to detect the face and identify the emotions accurately and automatically. The proposed technique encompasses a three state process: face detection, emotion classification, and hyperparameter tuning. In addition, YOLOv5 was utilized for face detection. For emotion classification, spatial attention network with convolutional neural network (SAN-CNN) was utilized. For improving the performance of the SAN-CNN approach, the ESGO algorithm was employed as hyperparameter optimizer. A comprehensive group of simulations are implemented on benchmark datasets and outcome was examined in many aspects. The experimental results stated that the control of the proposed technique over the other existing approaches interms of several performance measures.",

        "abstract": "A novel view of the available evidence of tryptophan and downstream metabolites in PCOS in the context of underlying inflammation is provided and the influence of sex steroid hormones on different enzymes of the KP is described. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex metabolic disorder commonly seen in females of reproductive age. The pathophysiology of PCOS is multifactorial and includes dysfunction in ovarian steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis, impaired gonadotropin levels, insulin resistance, gut microbiota imbalance, genetic predisposition, and lifestyle preferences. Low-grade inflammatory conditions such as obesity and impaired glucose tolerance are common metabolic disturbances in women with PCOS. A growing body of literature suggests strong evidence rendering PCOS in close proximity with chronic inflammation as documented by high levels of serum white blood cells, C-reactive protein, and various proinflammatory cytokines seen in this condition. Inflammation seems to be the most common metabolic denominator between the kynurenine pathway and PCOS. The association of tryptophan and kynurenine pathway has already been well documented in mood disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, chronic pain conditions, and different inflammatory states. In this manuscript, we describe the influence of sex steroid hormones on different enzymes of the KP; inflammatory nature of PCOS and CRP as a marker of IDO/TDO activity; and the effects of altered gut flora in women with PCOS. This review provides a novel view of the available evidence of tryptophan and downstream metabolites in PCOS in the context of underlying inflammation.",

        "abstract": "An overview of somatic cell and stem cell technologies in different taxa (mammals, fishes, birds, reptiles and amphibians) and evaluates the potential and impact of these approaches for animal species conservation is provided. More than a decade has now passed since the birth of the first endangered species produced from an adult somatic cell reprogrammed by somatic cell nuclear transfer. At that time, advances made in domestic and laboratory animal species provided the necessary foundation for attempting cutting-edge technologies on threatened and endangered species. In addition to nuclear transfer, spermatogonial stem cell transplantation and induction of pluripotent stem cells have also been explored. Although many basic scientific questions have been answered and more than 30 wild species have been investigated, very few successes have been reported. The majority of studies document numerous obstacles that still need to be overcome to produce viable gametes or embryos for healthy offspring production. This chapter provides an overview of somatic cell and stem cell technologies in different taxa (mammals, fishes, birds, reptiles and amphibians) and evaluates the potential and impact of these approaches for animal species conservation.",

Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), which make up a significant portion of the mammalian transcriptome and plays crucial regulatory roles in expression of genes and other biological processes, have recently been found. The most extensively researched of the sncRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), have been characterized in terms of their synthesis, roles, and significance in the tumor development. Its crucial function in the stem cell regulation, another class of sncRNAs known as aspirRNAs, has attracted attention in cancer research. The investigations have shown that long non-coding RNAs have a crucial role in controlling developmental stages, such as mammary gland development. Additionally, it has been discovered that lncRNA dysregulation precedes the development of several malignancies, including breast cancer. The functions of sncRNAs (including miRNAs and piRNAs) and lncRNAs in the onset and development of the breast cancer are described in this study. Additionally, future perspectives of various ncRNA-based diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches also discussed.",

        "title": "Comparison between slow freezing and vitrification for human embryos",
        "abstract": "From several recent studies, it appears that the vitrification method is better than slowcooling procedures in assisted reproductive technologies and will be chosen over the slow freezing method to freeze human embryos at any stage as well as oocytes in the near future. Embryo cryopreservation has several potential advantages in human in vitro fertilization. The goal of the cryopreservation procedure in human assisted reproductive technologies should be to ensure high survival and viability of human embryos after thawing. Two important parameters determine the success of any cryopreservation protocol: the manner in which cells regain equilibrium in response to cooling and the speed of freezing (cooling rate). Traditional slow-freezing protocols have been used to freeze all kinds of human embryos, but clinically satisfactory results have not been obtained; furthermore, the results are not consistent. In addition, the slow-freezing method requires expensive equipment and is time-consuming. Vitrification, in which high cooling rates in combination with a high concentration of cryoprotectant are used, does not produce any ice crystals during cooling and warming. From several recent studies, it appears that the vitrification method is better than slowcooling procedures in assisted reproductive technologies. Although many of the potential problems, such as toxic effects caused by high concentration of cryoprotectants or liquid nitrogen-mediated contamination, the vitrification method has received increasing interest during the last few years and has achieved significant developments. Therefore, in the near future, the vitrification method will be chosen over the slow freezing method to freeze human embryos at any stage as well as oocytes. Assisted reproductive technologies have been used to help couples with infertility problems. Recently, many related techniques have been improved in terms of ovarian stimulation, criteria and selection processes to assess the quality and viability of gametes and embryos, as well as culture conditions and culture media. These have led to the ability to obtain significantly more viable and transferable embryos. Moreover, awareness of the risks linked to multiple pregnancies has required the implementation of standards limiting the number of embryos transferred at any one time. Therefore, cryopreservation of residual human embryos between zygotes and blastocyst stages has become a routine procedure to increase cumulative pregnancy rates, to help avoid the risk of multiple pregnancies after the transfer of many embryos, avoid unnecessary additional stimulation procedures and escape the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome [1]. During various stages of the cryopreservation process, including exposure to cryoprotectants, cooling, storage in liquid nitrogen, rewarming and return to a physiological solution, it is solely the skill of being able to prevent ice-crystal formation that determines the viability of an embryo after rewarming. It is obvious that ice crystallization is incompatible with any developmental stage embryos and must be avoided as far as possible [2]. There are two general approaches to prevent ice crystals: slow-rate freezing and vitrification. Since Whittingham et al. reported the first successful live offspring after cryopreservation [3], based on the use of slow freezing on mouse embryos, the cryopreservation technique was applied to human early cleavage-stage embryos and resulted in the first report of pregnancy and live birth from human cryopreserved embryos [4,5].

        "abstract": "It is demonstrated that the miR-424/E2F6 feedback loop modulates cell invasion, migration and EMT in EC and that the microRNA-424 / E2Fs regulation network may serve as a new and potentially important therapeutic target in EC. Our previous study explored the roles of microRNA-424 (miR-424) in the development of endometrial carcinoma (EC) and analyzed the miR-424/E2F7 axis in EC cell growth. In this study, we investigated the status of miR-424 in human endometrial cancer tissues, which were collected from a cohort of Zunyi patients. We found that the expression level of miR-424 was associated with clinical tumor stage, cell differentiation, lymph node metastasis and cell migration ability. Cell function experiments demonstrated that miR-424 overexpression suppressed the invasion and migration abilities of endometrial carcinoma cells in vitro. Bioinformatic predictions and dual-luciferase reporter assays suggested E2F6 as a possible target of miR-424. RT-PCR and western blot assays demonstrated that miR-424 transfection reduced the expression level of E2F6, while inhibiting miR-424 with ASO-miR-424 (antisense oligonucleotides of miR-424) increased the expression level of E2F6. Cell function experiments indicated that E2F6 transfection rescued the EC cell phenotype induced by miR-424. In addition, we also found that E2F6 negatively regulated miR-424 expression in EC cells. In summary, our results demonstrated that the miR-424/E2F6 feedback loop modulates cell invasion, migration and EMT in EC and that the miR-424/E2Fs regulation network may serve as a new and potentially important therapeutic target in EC.",

        "abstract": "3D bioprinting of a sacrificial PVA framework to impart its trilobular hepatic structure to the decellularized liver extracellular matrix (dLM) hydrogel with polyethylene glycol-based crosslinker and tyrosinase to fabricate a robust multi-scale 3D liver construct is reported. The liver exhibits complex geometrical morphologies of hepatic cells arranged in a hexagonal lobule with an extracellular matrix (ECM) organized in a specific pattern on a multi-scale level. Previous studies have utilized 3D bioprinting and microfluidic perfusion systems with various biomaterials to develop lobule-like constructs. However, they all lack anatomical relevance with weak control over the size and shape of the fabricated structures. Moreover, most biomaterials lack liver-specific ECM components partially or entirely, which might limit their biomimetic mechanical properties and biological functions. Here, we report 3D bioprinting of a sacrificial PVA framework to impart its trilobular hepatic structure to the decellularized liver extracellular matrix (dLM) hydrogel with polyethylene glycol-based crosslinker and tyrosinase to fabricate a robust multi-scale 3D liver construct. The 3D trilobular construct exhibits higher crosslinking, viscosity (182.7 \u00b1 1.6 Pa\u00b7s), and storage modulus (2554 \u00b1 82.1 Pa) than non-crosslinked dLM. The co-culture of HepG2 liver cells and NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells exhibited the influence of fibroblasts on liver-specific activity over time (7 days) to show higher viability (90\u201391.5%), albumin secretion, and increasing activity of four liver-specific genes as compared to the HepG2 monoculture. This technique offers high lumen patency for the perfusion of media to fabricate a densely populated scaled-up liver model, which can also be extended to other tissue types with different biomaterials and multiple cells to support the creation of a large functional complex tissue.",

        "abstract": "Genetic modification to overexpress IL-37 might offer a way to enhance the stability and effectiveness of MSCs in treating SLE, andMutually reinforcing interaction between M SCs and IL- 37 appears to underlie their additive therapeutic effects. BACKGROUND\nAlthough mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) might offer a promising strategy for treating SLE, their immunoregulatory plasticity makes their therapeutic effects unpredictable. Whether overexpressing IL-37, an IL-1 family member with immunosuppressive activity, might enhance the therapeutic effects of these cells for SLE is unknown.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe genetically modified MSCs to overexpress IL-37 and assessed their effects on immune suppression in vitro. We also evaluated the effects of such cells versus effects of various controls after transplanting them into MRL/lpr mice (model of SLE).\n\n\nRESULTS\nStem cell characteristics did not appear altered in MSCs overexpressing IL-37. These cells had enhanced immunosuppression in vitro in terms of inhibiting splenocyte proliferation, reducing proinflammatory factors (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-17, and IL-6), and suppressing autoantibodies (anti-dsDNA and anti-ANA). Compared with animals receiving control MSCs or IL-37 treatment alone, MRL/lpr mice transplanted with IL-37-overexpressing cells displayed improved survival and reduced signs of SLE (indicated by urine protein levels, spleen weight, and renal pathologic scores); they also had significantly lower expression of proinflammatory factors, lower total antibody levels in serum and urine, lower autoantibody production, and showed reduced T cell numbers in the serum and kidney. Expression of IL-37 by MSCs can maintain higher serum levels of IL-37, and MSCs had prolonged survival after transplantation, perhaps through IL-37 suppressing the inflammatory microenvironment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nMutually reinforcing interaction between MSCs and IL-37 appears to underlie their additive therapeutic effects. Genetic modification to overexpress IL-37 might offer a way to enhance the stability and effectiveness of MSCs in treating SLE.",

        "abstract": "This introductory article begins from Sylvio Weidmann's key historic 1950s microelectrode measurements of cardiac electrophysiological activity and Singh & Vaughan Williams's classification of cardiotropic targets to introduce the insights into cardiomyocyte function and its regulation that subsequently emerged and their therapeutic implications. Normal and abnormal cardiac rhythms are of key physiological and clinical interest. This introductory article begins from Sylvio Weidmann's key historic 1950s microelectrode measurements of cardiac electrophysiological activity and Singh & Vaughan Williams's classification of cardiotropic targets. It then proceeds to introduce the insights into cardiomyocyte function and its regulation that subsequently emerged and their therapeutic implications. We recapitulate the resulting view that surface membrane electrophysiological events underlying cardiac excitation and its initiation, conduction and recovery constitute the final common path for the cellular mechanisms that impinge upon this normal or abnormal cardiac electrophysiological activity. We then consider progress in the more recently characterized successive regulatory hierarchies involving Ca2+ homeostasis, excitation\u2013contraction coupling and autonomic G-protein signalling and their often reciprocal interactions with the surface membrane events, and their circadian rhythms. Then follow accounts of longer-term upstream modulation processes involving altered channel expression, cardiomyocyte energetics and hypertrophic and fibrotic cardiac remodelling. Consideration of these developments introduces each of the articles in this Phil. Trans. B theme issue. The findings contained in these articles translate naturally into recent classifications of cardiac electrophysiological targets and drug actions, thereby encouraging future iterations of experimental cardiac electrophysiological discovery, and testing directed towards clinical management. This article is part of the theme issue \u2018The heartbeat: its molecular basis and physiological mechanisms\u2019.",

        "abstract": "The recent advances in bioengineering technologies in liver organoid culture systems that provide a timely and necessary study to model disease pathology and support drug discovery in vitro and to generate cell therapy products for transplantation are discussed. The current organoid culture systems allow pluripotent and adult stem cells to self-organize to form three-dimensional (3D) structures that provide a faithful recapitulation of the architecture and function of in vivo organs. In particular, human pluripotent stem cell-derived liver organoids (PSC-LOs) can be used in regenerative medicine and preclinical applications, such as disease modeling and drug discovery. New bioengineering tools, such as microfluidics, biomaterial scaffolds, and 3D bioprinting, are combined with organoid technologies to increase the efficiency of hepatic differentiation and enhance the functional maturity of human PSC-LOs by precise control of cellular microenvironment. Long-term stabilization of hepatocellular functions of in vitro liver organoids requires the combination of hepatic endodermal, endothelial, and mesenchymal cells. To improve the biological function and scalability of human PSC-LOs, bioengineering methods have been used to identify diverse and zonal hepatocyte populations in liver organoids for capturing heterogeneous pathologies. Therefore, constructing engineered liver organoids generated from human PSCs will be an extremely versatile tool in in vitro disease models and regenerative medicine in future. In this review, we aim to discuss the recent advances in bioengineering technologies in liver organoid culture systems that provide a timely and necessary study to model disease pathology and support drug discovery in vitro and to generate cell therapy products for transplantation.",

        "abstract": "The results suggest that therapy based on bioactive factors released by the immortalized atMSC into supernatant has important effect on skin-derived cell proliferation and might preclude the need for a more expensive and difficult cell therapy approach to improve chronic wound healing. Background Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) secrete a cocktail of growth factors and cytokines, which could promote tissue regeneration and wound healing. Therefore, in clinical practice, post-culture MSC supernatant treatment could be a more attractive alternative to autologous stem cell transplantation. In this study, we compared the regenerative properties of supernatants harvested from four newly established human adipose tissue mesenchymal stem cell lines (HATMSCs) derived from chronic wound patients or healthy donors. Methods HATMSC supernatants were produced in a serum-free medium under hypoxia and their content was analyzed by a human angiogenesis antibody array. The regenerative effect of HATMSCs supernatants was investigated in an in vitro model of chronic wound, where cells originating from human skin, such as microvascular endothelial cells (HSkMEC.2), keratinocytes (HaCaT), and fibroblasts (MSU-1.1), were cultured in serum-free and oxygen-reduced conditions. The effect of supernatant treatment was evaluated using an MTT assay and light microscopy. In addition, fibroblasts and HATMSCs were labeled with PKH67 and PKH26 dye, respectively, and the effect of supernatant treatment was compared to that obtained when fibroblasts and HATMSCs were co-cultured, using flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy. Results A wide panel of angiogenesis-associated cytokines such as angiogenin, growth-regulated oncogene (GRO), interleukin-6 and 8 (IL-6, IL-8), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) were found in all tested HATMSCs supernatants . Moreover, supernatant treatment significantly enhanced the survival of fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes in our chronic wound model in vitro. Importantly, we have shown that in in vitro settings, HATMSC supernatant treatment results in superior fibroblast proliferation than in the case of co-culture with HATMSCs. Conclusions Our results suggest that therapy based on bioactive factors released by the immortalized atMSC into supernatant has important effect on skin-derived cell proliferation and might preclude the need for a more expensive and difficult cell therapy approach to improve chronic wound healing.",

        "abstract": "The results suggested that SRSF1 has a negative prognostic role and a pro-angiogenic function in UM. Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most frequent primary ocular malignancy of adults; it exhibits an almost invariably poor prognosis with onset of liver metastases within 10\u201315 years after the diagnosis. Serine and arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) is an RNA-binding protein with proto-oncogene functions, including stimulation of angiogenesis, cell migration and cell growth; regarding the complex regulation of tumor angiogenesis, it has been suggested that SRSF1 regulates the alternative splicing of vascular endothelial growth factor-\u03b1, promoting the formation of its pro-angiogenic isoform. The immunohistochemical expression of SRSF1 on a series of 85 primary UMs, including 39 metastasizing and 46 non-metastasizing cases, was investigated; to clarify the potential pathogenetic role of SRSF1 in this tumor and its effect on angiogenesis, we correlated our immunohistochemical findings with the clinico-pathological features, the prognostic data and blood vascular microvessel density (MVD) findings of the cases from our series. Cases with higher immunohistochemical expression of SRSF1 also had higher MVD, higher metastatic potential and shorter metastasis-free survival; conversely, cases with lower SRSF1 immunoexpression showed lower MVD, lower metastatic risk and longer metastasis-free survival times. Our results suggested that SRSF1 has a negative prognostic role and a pro-angiogenic function in UM.",

        "abstract": "The history and current progress in domestic farm animal iPSC generation is summarized, with a focus on swine, ruminants, horses, and avian species (quails and chickens), and potential future directions towards the complete reprogramming of somatic cells from farm animals are discussed. The development of the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technology has revolutionized the world on the establishment of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) across a great variety of animal species. Generation of iPSCs from domesticated animals would provide unrestricted cell resources for the study of embryonic development and cell differentiation of these species, for screening and establishing desired traits for sustainable agricultural production, and as veterinary and preclinical therapeutic tools for animal and human diseases. iPSCs from domesticated animals thus harbor enormous scientific, economical and societal values. Although much progress has been made towards the generation of PSCs from these species, major obstacles remain precluding the exclamation of the establishment of bona fide iPSCs. The most prominent of them remain the inability of these cells to silence exogenous reprogramming factors and the obvious reliance on exogenous factors for their self-renewal, and restricted development potential in vivo. In this review, we summarize the history and current progress in domestic farm animal iPSC generation, with a focus on swine, ruminants (cattle, ovine, and caprine), horses, and avian species (quails and chickens). We also discuss the problems associated with the farm animal iPSCs and potential future directions towards the complete reprogramming of somatic cells from farm animals.",

        "abstract": "The regenerative potential of UC-MSCs for the treatment of cartilage diseases will be discussed focusing on in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies. Chondropathies are increasing worldwide, but effective treatments are currently lacking. Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSCs) transplantation represents a promising approach to counteract the degenerative and inflammatory environment characterizing those pathologies, such as osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Umbilical cord- (UC-) MSCs gained increasing interest due to their multilineage differentiation potential, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties as well as higher proliferation rates, abundant supply along with no risks for the donor compared to adult MSCs. In addition, UC-MSCs are physiologically adapted to survive in an ischemic and nutrient-poor environment as well as to produce an extracellular matrix (ECM) similar to that of the cartilage. All these characteristics make UC-MSCs a pivotal source for a stem cell-based treatment of chondropathies. In this review, the regenerative potential of UC-MSCs for the treatment of cartilage diseases will be discussed focusing on in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies.",

        "abstract": "The characteristics of stem-cell-based therapies for liver diseases are discussed and the current status and future prospects of using HLCs, LPCs or liver organoids in clinical trials are presented. The liver represents the most important metabolic organ of the human body. It is evident that an imbalance of liver function can lead to several pathological conditions, known as liver failure. Orthotropic liver transplantation (OLT) is currently the most effective and established treatment for end-stage liver diseases and acute liver failure (ALF). Due to several limitations, stem-cell-based therapies are currently being developed as alternative solutions. Stem cells or progenitor cells derived from various sources have emerged as an alternative source of hepatic regeneration. Therefore, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are also known to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells (HPLCs) and liver progenitor cells (LPCs) that can be used in preclinical or clinical studies of liver disease. Furthermore, these cells have been shown to be effective in the development of liver organoids that can be used for disease modeling, drug testing and regenerative medicine. In this review, we aim to discuss the characteristics of stem-cell-based therapies for liver diseases and present the current status and future prospects of using HLCs, LPCs or liver organoids in clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "This work is to create a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model that classifies 5 different human facial emotions using the manually collected image dataset. The rapid growth of artificial intelligence has contributed a lot to the technology world. As the traditional algorithms failed to meet the human needs in real time, Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have gained great success in different applications such as classification systems, recommendation systems, pattern recognition etc. Emotion plays a vital role in determining the thoughts, behaviour and feeling of a human. An emotion recognition system can be built by utilizing the benefits of deep learning and different applications such as feedback analysis, face unlocking etc. can be implemented with good accuracy. The main focus of this work is to create a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model that classifies 5 different human facial emotions. The model is trained, tested and validated using the manually collected image dataset.",

        "abstract": "The roles of gut microbiota could lead to the development of remarkable treatments for the prevention of and/or the therapeutics for various intractable immune-related diseases. The tryptophan and kynurenine pathway is well-known to play an important role in nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, as well as in the development of inflammatory diseases. It has been documented that some kynurenine metabolites are considered to have anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and/or neuroprotective properties. Importantly, many of these kynurenine metabolites may possess immune-regulatory properties that could alleviate the inflammation response. The abnormal activation of the tryptophan and kynurenine pathway might be involved in the pathophysiological process of various immune-related diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and/or polycystic ovary syndrome. Interestingly, kynurenine metabolites may be involved in the brain memory system and/or intricate immunity via the modulation of glial function. In the further deliberation of this concept with engram, the roles of gut microbiota could lead to the development of remarkable treatments for the prevention of and/or the therapeutics for various intractable immune-related diseases.",

        "abstract": "The results suggest that Lnc-AK045490 suppresses \u03b2-catenin/TCF1/Runx2 signaling and inhibits osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, providing a novel mechanism of osteogenic differentiation and a potential drug target for osteoporosis. Osteoporosis, a disease characterized by both loss of bone mass and structural deterioration of bone, is the most common reason for a broken bone among the elderly. It is known that the attenuated differentiation ability of osteogenic cells has been regarded as one of the greatest contributors to age-related bone formation reduction. However, the effects of current therapies are still unsatisfactory. In this study we identify a novel long noncoding RNA AK045490 which is correlated with osteogenic differentiation and enriched in skeletal tissues of mice. In vitro analysis of bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) showed that AK045490 inhibited osteoblast differentiation. In vivo inhibition of AK045490 by its small interfering RNA rescued bone formation in ovariectomized osteoporosis mice model. Mechanistically, AK045490 inhibited the nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin and downregulated the expression of TCF1, LEF1, and Runx2. The results suggest that Lnc-AK045490 suppresses \u03b2-catenin/TCF1/Runx2 signaling and inhibits osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, providing a novel mechanism of osteogenic differentiation and a potential drug target for osteoporosis.",

The recent progress in derivation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) from farm animals opens new approaches not only for reproduction, genetic engineering, treatment and conservation of these species, but also for screening novel drugs for their efficacy and toxicity, and modelling of human diseases. Initial attempts to derive PSCs from the inner cell mass of blastocyst stages in farm animals were largely unsuccessful as either the cells survived for only a few passages, or lost their cellular potency; indicating that the protocols which allowed the derivation of murine or human embryonic stem (ES) cells were not sufficient to support the maintenance of ES cells from farm animals. This scenario changed by the innovation of induced pluripotency and by the development of the 3 inhibitor culture conditions to support na\u00efve pluripotency in ES cells from livestock species. However, the long-term culture of livestock PSCs while maintaining the full pluripotency is still challenging, and requires further refinements. Here, we review the current achievements in the derivation of PSCs from farm animals, and discuss the potential application areas.",

        "abstract": "The roles of sncRNAs (including miRNAs and piRNAs) and lncRNAs in the initiation and progression of breast tumorigenesis are described and discussed, with a focus on outlining the molecular mechanisms of oncogenic and tumor-suppressor nc RNAs. The mammalian transcriptome has recently been revealed to encompass a large number of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that play a variety of important regulatory roles in gene expression and other biological processes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), the best studied of the short noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs), have been extensively characterized with regard to their biogenesis, function and importance in tumorigenesis. Another class of sncRNAs called piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) has also gained attention recently in cancer research owing to their critical role in stem cell regulation. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) of >200 nucleotides in length have recently emerged as key regulators of developmental processes, including mammary gland development. lncRNA dysregulation has also been implicated in the development of various cancers, including breast cancer. In this review, we describe and discuss the roles of sncRNAs (including miRNAs and piRNAs) and lncRNAs in the initiation and progression of breast tumorigenesis, with a focus on outlining the molecular mechanisms of oncogenic and tumor-suppressor ncRNAs. Moreover, the current and potential future applications of ncRNAs to clinical breast cancer research are also discussed, with an emphasis on ncRNA-based diagnosis, prognosis and future therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "RG108 is an effective tumor growth suppressor in most PCa cell lines tested and is likely mediated by reversion of aberrant DNA methylation affecting cancer related-genes epigenetically silenced in PCa. BACKGROUND\nCurrent therapeutic strategies for advanced prostate cancer (PCa) are largely ineffective. Because aberrant DNA methylation associated with inappropriate gene-silencing is a common feature of PCa, DNA methylation inhibitors might constitute an alternative therapy. In this study we aimed to evaluate the anti-cancer properties of RG108, a novel non-nucleoside inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), in PCa cell lines.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe anti-tumoral impact of RG108 in LNCaP, 22Rv1, DU145 and PC-3 cell lines was assessed through standard cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle assays. Likewise, DNMT activity, DNMT1 expression and global levels of DNA methylation were evaluated in the same cell lines. The effectiveness of DNA demethylation was further assessed through the determination of promoter methylation and transcript levels of GSTP1, APC and RAR-\u03b22, by quantitative methylation-specific PCR and RT-PCR, respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRG108 led to a significant dose and time dependent growth inhibition and apoptosis induction in LNCaP, 22Rv1 and DU145. LNCaP and 22Rv1 also displayed decreased DNMT activity, DNMT1 expression and global DNA methylation. Interestingly, chronic treatment with RG108 significantly decreased GSTP1, APC and RAR-\u03b22 promoter hypermethylation levels, although mRNA reexpression was only attained for GSTP1 and APC.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRG108 is an effective tumor growth suppressor in most PCa cell lines tested. This effect is likely mediated by reversion of aberrant DNA methylation affecting cancer related-genes epigenetically silenced in PCa. However, additional mechanism might underlie the anti-tumor effects of RG108. In vivo studies are now mandatory to confirm these promising results and evaluate the potential of this compound for PCa therapy.",

ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of using a sucrose gradient-based warming protocol as a universal warming approach on human cleavage stage embryos. Between January 2013 and November 2014, a total of 118 warming cycles were performed on 705 embryos which had previously been cryopreserved/thawed by slow freezing protocols or cryopreserved by slow freezing and warmed by vitrification thaw solution. Clinical outcomes have been retrospectively analyzed depending on cryopreservation and warming techniques used, embryo viability, day of cryopreservation, clinical pregnancy, implantation, and live birth rate. Results indicate that, the use of the vitrification warming protocol for warming after slow freezing results in comparable post-warming survival (71.6% and 71.1%; p = 0.890). Higher clinical pregnancy, implantation, and live birth rates were obtained in the cryopreserved embryos by slow freezing and warmed by vitrification group in comparison to the cryopreserved/thawed by slow freezing protocols group but the results did not show statistically significant differences between groups (p > 0.05). These results indicate that such an approach can eliminate the need to search for a brand-dependent product, as well as case-dependent hands-on planning.

        "abstract": "It is found that miR-424-5p was up-regulated in GC tissues and cells and could inhibit TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway by Smad3 and could promote the proliferation of GC cells. MiRNAs have been reported to regulate gene expression and be associated with cancer progression. Recently, miR-424-5p was reported to play important role in a variety of tumors. However, the role and molecular mechanisms of miR-424-5p in GC (gastric cancer) remains largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of miR-424-5p in GC. QRT-PCR was used to determine the expression levels of miR-424-5p and Smad3. CCK8 assay, plate clone assay and cell cycle assay were used to measure the effects of miR-424-5p on GC cell proliferation. Luciferase reporter assay and western blotting were used to prove that Smad3 was one of the direct targets of miR-424-5p. Tumorigenesis assay was used to investigate the role of miR-424-5p in tumor growth of GC cells in vivo. We found that miR-424-5p was up-regulated in GC tissues and cells. Over-expression of miR-424-5p could promote the proliferation of GC cells. In addition, luciferase reporter assay and western blotting assay revealed that Smad3 was a direct target of miR-424-5p. Over-expression of Smad3 could partially reverse the effects of miR-424-5p on GC cell proliferation. Our study further revealed that miR-424-5p could inhibit TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway by Smad3.",

Hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) cancer is a serious category of cancer including tumors originating in the liver, pancreas, gallbladder and biliary ducts. It is limited by two-dimensional (2D) cell culture models for studying its complicated tumor microenvironment including diverse contents and dynamic nature. Recently developed three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is a state-of-the-art technology for fabrication of biological constructs through layer-by-layer deposition of bioinks in a spatially defined manner, which is computer-aided and designed to generate viable 3D constructs. 3D bioprinting has the potential to more closely recapitulate the tumor microenvironment, dynamic and complex cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions compared to the current methods, which benefits from its precise definition of positioning of various cell types and perfusing network in a high-throughput manner. In this review, we introduce and compare multiple types of 3D bioprinting methodologies for HPB cancer and other digestive tumors. We discuss the progress and application of 3D bioprinting in HPB and gastrointestinal cancers, focusing on tumor model manufacturing. We also highlight the current challenges regarding clinical translation of 3D bioprinting and bioinks in the field of digestive tumor research. Finally, we suggest valuable perspectives for this advanced technology, including combination of 3D bioprinting with microfluidics and application of 3D bioprinting in the field of tumor immunology.",

        "title": "Murine Electrophysiological Models of Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis.",
        "abstract": "Experimental studies on murine models for known clinical arrhythmic conditions in which these mechanisms were modified by genetic, physiological, or pharmacological manipulation are described. Cardiac arrhythmias can follow disruption of the normal cellular electrophysiological processes underlying excitable activity and their tissue propagation as coherent wavefronts from the primary sinoatrial node pacemaker, through the atria, conducting structures and ventricular myocardium. These physiological events are driven by interacting, voltage-dependent, processes of activation, inactivation, and recovery in the ion channels present in cardiomyocyte membranes. Generation and conduction of these events are further modulated by intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, and metabolic and structural change. This review describes experimental studies on murine models for known clinical arrhythmic conditions in which these mechanisms were modified by genetic, physiological, or pharmacological manipulation. These exemplars yielded molecular, physiological, and structural phenotypes often directly translatable to their corresponding clinical conditions, which could be investigated at the molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, and whole animal levels. Arrhythmogenesis could be explored during normal pacing activity, regular stimulation, following imposed extra-stimuli, or during progressively incremented steady pacing frequencies. Arrhythmic substrate was identified with temporal and spatial functional heterogeneities predisposing to reentrant excitation phenomena. These could arise from abnormalities in cardiac pacing function, tissue electrical connectivity, and cellular excitation and recovery. Triggering events during or following recovery from action potential excitation could thereby lead to sustained arrhythmia. These surface membrane processes were modified by alterations in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and energetics, as well as cellular and tissue structural change. Study of murine systems thus offers major insights into both our understanding of normal cardiac activity and its propagation, and their relationship to mechanisms generating clinical arrhythmias.",

        "abstract": "A novel high-throughput culture method to generate uniform liver organoids from human pluripotent stem cell-derived foregut stem cells in micropatterned agarose scaffold and evaluated the acute hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen in these organoids and observed APAP-induced liver fibrosis. Liver organoids represent emerging human-relevant in vitro liver models that have a wide range of biomedical applications in basic medical studies and preclinical drug discovery. However, the generation of liver organoids currently relies on the conventional Matrigel dome method, which lacks precise microenvironmental control over organoid growth and results in significant heterogeneity of the formed liver organoids. Here, we demonstrate a novel high-throughput culture method to generate uniform liver organoids from human pluripotent stem cell-derived foregut stem cells in micropatterned agarose scaffold. By using this approach, more than 8000 uniformly-sized liver organoids containing liver parenchyma cells, non-parenchymal cells, and a unique stem cell niche could be efficiently and reproducibly generated in a 48-well plate with a size coefficient of variation significance smaller than that in the Matrigel dome. Additionally, the liver organoids highly expressed liver-specific markers, including albumin (ALB), hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4\u03b1), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and displayed liver functions, such as lipid accumulation, glycogen synthesis, ALB secretion, and urea synthesis. As a proof of concept, we evaluated the acute hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen (APAP) in these organoids and observed APAP-induced liver fibrosis. Overall, we expect that the liver organoids will facilitate wide biomedical applications in hepatotoxicity analysis and liver disease modeling.",

        "abstract": "The immortalized MSCs line was established from human adipose tissue to produce conditioned media and test its regenerative potential in vitro in terms of possible clinical application and it was found that hypoxia during culture resulted in an augmentation in the pro-angiogenic factors production, such as VEGF, IL-8, Angiogenin and MCP-1. For twenty-five years, attempts have been made to use MSCs in the treatment of various diseases due to their regenerative and immunomodulatory properties. However, the results are not satisfactory. Assuming that MSCs can be replaced in some therapies by the active factors they produce, the immortalized MSCs line was established from human adipose tissue (HATMSC1) to produce conditioned media and test its regenerative potential in vitro in terms of possible clinical application. The production of biologically active factors by primary MSCs was lower compared to the HATMSC1 cell line and several factors were produced only by the cell line. It has been shown that an HATMSC1-conditioned medium increases the proliferation of various cell types, augments the adhesion of cells and improves endothelial cell function. It was found that hypoxia during culture resulted in an augmentation in the pro-angiogenic factors production, such as VEGF, IL-8, Angiogenin and MCP-1. The immunomodulatory factors caused an increase in the production of GM-CSF, IL-5, IL-6, MCP-1, RANTES and IL-8. These data suggest that these factors, produced under different culture conditions, could be used for different medical conditions, such as in regenerative medicine, when an increased concentration of pro-angiogenic factors may be beneficial, or in inflammatory diseases with conditioned media with a high concentration of immunomodulatory factors.",

        "abstract": "For the first time UDCs were isolated in the swine model and reprogrammed into a pluripotent-like state, enabling new numerous applications in both human or veterinary regenerative medicine. BACKGROUND The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) has been a game-changer in translational and regenerative medicine; however, their large-scale applicability is still hampered by the scarcity of accessible, safe, and reproducible protocols. The porcine model is a large biomedical model that enables translational applications, including gene editing, long term in vivo and offspring analysis; therefore, suitable for both medicine and animal production. AIM To reprogramme in vitro into pluripotency, and herein urine-derived cells (UDCs) were isolated from porcine urine. METHODS The UDCs were reprogrammed in vitro using human or murine octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4), SRY-box2 (SOX2), Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), and C-MYC, and cultured with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) supplementation. To characterize the putative porcine iPSCs three clonal lineages were submitted to immunocytochemistry for alkaline phosphatase (AP), OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, TRA1 81 and SSEA 1 detection. Endogenous transcripts related to the pluripotency (OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG) were analyzed via reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in different time points during the culture, and all three lineages formed embryoid bodies (EBs) when cultured in suspension without bFGF supplementation. RESULTS The UDCs were isolated from swine urine samples and when at passage 2 submitted to in vitro reprogramming. Colonies of putative iPSCs were obtained only from UDCs transduced with the murine factors (mOSKM), but not from human factors (hOSKM). Three clonal lineages were isolated and further cultured for at least 28 passages, all the lineages were positive for AP detection, the OCT4, SOX2, NANOG markers, albeit the immunocytochemical analysis also revealed heterogeneous phenotypic profiles among lineages and passages for NANOG and SSEA1, similar results were observed in the abundance of the endogenous transcripts related to pluripotent state. All the clonal lineages when cultured in suspension without bFGF were able to form EBs expressing ectoderm and mesoderm layers transcripts. CONCLUSION For the first time UDCs were isolated in the swine model and reprogrammed into a pluripotent-like state, enabling new numerous applications in both human or veterinary regenerative medicine.",

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which counts more than 650 million cases and more than 6.6 million of deaths worldwide, affects the respiratory system with typical symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and fatigue. Other nonpulmonary manifestations are related with abnormal inflammatory response, the \u201ccytokine storm\u201d, that could lead to a multiorgan disease and to death. Evolution of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 provided multiple options to prevent the infection, but the treatment of the severe forms remains difficult to manage. The cytokine storm is usually counteracted with standard medical care and anti-inflammatory drugs, but researchers moved forward their studies on new strategies based on cell therapy approaches. The perinatal tissues, such as placental membranes, amniotic fluid, and umbilical cord derivatives, are enriched in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) that exert a well-known anti-inflammatory role, immune response modulation, and tissue repair. In this review, we focused on umbilical-cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) used in in vitro and in vivo studies in order to evaluate the weakening of the severe symptoms, and on recent clinical trials from different databases, supporting the favorable potential of UC-MSCs as therapeutic strategy.",

        "abstract": "3D culture of the hepatic endoderm is a relatively fast, simple, and less laborious way to generate liver organoids from HuiPSCs that is more physiologically relevant than 2D culture. Background The use of a personalized liver organoid derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (HuiPSCs) is advancing the use of in vitro disease models for the design of specific, effective therapies for individuals. Collecting patient peripheral blood cells for HuiPSC generation is preferable because it is less invasive; however, the capability of blood cell-derived HuiPSCs for hepatic differentiation and liver organoid formation remains uncertain. Moreover, the currently available methods for liver organoid formation require a multistep process of cell differentiation or a combination of hepatic endodermal, endothelial and mesenchymal cells, which is a major hurdle for the application of personalized liver organoids in high-throughput testing of drug toxicity and safety. To demonstrate the capability of blood cell-derived HuiPSCs for liver organoid formation without support from endothelial and mesenchymal cells. Methods The peripheral blood-derived HuiPSCs first differentiated into hepatic endoderm (HE) in two-dimensional (2D) culture on Matrigel-coated plates under hypoxia for 10 days. The HE was then collected and cultured in 3D culture using 50% Matrigel under ambient oxygen. The maturation of hepatocytes was further induced by adding hepatocyte growth medium containing HGF and oncostatin M on top of the 3D culture and incubating the culture for an additional 12\u201317 days. The function of the liver organoids was assessed using expression analysis of hepatocyte-specific gene and proteins. Albumin (ALB) synthesis, glycogen and lipid storage, and metabolism of indocyanine were evaluated. The spatial distribution of albumin was examined using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Results CD34+ hematopoietic cell-derived HuiPSCs were capable of differentiating into definitive endoderm expressing SOX17 and FOXA2, hepatic endoderm expressing FOXA2, hepatoblasts expressing AFP and hepatocytes expressing ALB. On day 25 of the 2D culture, cells expressed SOX17, FOXA2, AFP and ALB, indicating the presence of cellular heterogeneity. In contrast, the hepatic endoderm spontaneously formed a spherical, hollow structure in a 3D culture of 50% Matrigel, whereas hepatoblasts and hepatocytes could not form. Microscopic observation showed a single layer of polygonal-shaped cells arranged in a 3D structure. The hepatic endoderm-derived organoid synthesis ALB at a higher level than the 2D culture but did not express definitive endoderm-specific SOX17, indicating the greater maturity of the hepatocytes in the liver organoids. Confocal microscopic images and quantitative ELISA confirmed albumin synthesis in the cytoplasm of the liver organoid and its secretion. Overall, 3D culture of the hepatic endoderm is a relatively fast, simple, and less laborious way to generate liver organoids from HuiPSCs that is more physiologically relevant than 2D culture.",

Recognizing the facial expressions for different emotions is to familiarize the machine with human like capacity to perceive and identify human feelings, which involves classifying the given input images of the face into one of the seven classes which is achieved by building a multi class classifier. The proposed methodology is based on convolutional neural organizations and works on 48x48 pixel-based grayscale images. The proposed model is tested on various images and gives the best accuracy when compared with existing functionalities. It detects faces in images, recognizes them and identifies emotions and shows improved performance because of data augmentation. The model is experimented with varying depths and pooling layers. The best results are obtained sequential model of six layers of Convolutional Neural Network and softmax activation function applied to last layer. The approach works for real time data taken from videos or photos.",

        "abstract": "The role of lncRNAs and circRNAs in different bone cells and osteoporosis is summarized so that it might help in the development of osteoporeotic therapeutics. Bone is a mechanosensitive organ that provides strength and support. Many bone cells, various pathways, and signaling molecules coordinate bone metabolism and also determine the course of bone diseases, such as osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, osteopenia, etc. Osteoporosis is caused by increased bone resorption and reduced bone formation due to the changes in the level of different proteins and RNAs in osteoclast or/and osteoblasts. The available therapeutic interventions can significantly reduce bone resorption or enhance bone formation, but their prolonged use has deleterious side effects. Therefore, the use of non-coding RNAs as therapeutics has emerged as an interesting field of research. Despite advancements in the molecular field, not much is known about the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) in bone homeostasis and osteoporosis. Therefore, in this article, we summarize the role of lncRNAs and circRNAs in different bone cells and osteoporosis so that it might help in the development of osteoporotic therapeutics.",

        "abstract": "The establishment of pluripotent cell lines in farm animals may provide new opportunities for the production of transgenic animals, would facilitate development and validation of large animal models for evaluating ESC-based therapies and would thus contribute to the improvement of human and animal health. Pluripotent cells, such as embryonic stem (ES) cells, embryonic germ cells and embryonic carcinoma cells are a unique type of cell because they remain undifferentiated indefinitely in in vitro culture, show self-renewal and possess the ability to differentiate into derivatives of the three germ layers. These capabilities make them a unique in vitro model for studying development, differentiation and for targeted modification of the genome. True pluripotent ESCs have only been described in the laboratory mouse and rat. However, rodent physiology and anatomy differ substantially from that of humans, detracting from the value of the rodent model for studies of human diseases and the development of cellular therapies in regenerative medicine. Recently, progress in the isolation of pluripotent cells in farm animals has been made and new technologies for reprogramming of somatic cells into a pluripotent state have been developed. Prior to clinical application of therapeutic cells differentiated from pluripotent stem cells in human patients, their survival and the absence of tumourigenic potential must be assessed in suitable preclinical large animal models. The establishment of pluripotent cell lines in farm animals may provide new opportunities for the production of transgenic animals, would facilitate development and validation of large animal models for evaluating ESC-based therapies and would thus contribute to the improvement of human and animal health. This review summarises the recent progress in the derivation of pluripotent and reprogrammed cells from farm animals. We refer to our recent review on this area, to which this article is complementary.",

        "abstract": "The findings suggested that tumor overexpression of DNMT1 and DNMT3A is associated with tumor aggressive behavior and high-methylation status in pituitary adenomas and suggest that inhibition ofDNMTs has the potential to become a new therapeutic approach for invasive pituitaries adenoma. Background Alteration of DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) is one of the most consistent epigenetic changes in human cancers. DNMTs play several important roles in DNA methylation and development of cancers. Regarding DNMTs protein expressions, little is known about the clinical significance and correlation with promoter methylation status of TSGs in human pituitary adenomas. Material/Methods We analyzed the protein expression of 3 DNMTs using immunohistochemistry and assessed DNA hypermethylation of RASSF1A, CDH13, CDH1, and CDKN2A (p16) in 63 pituitary adenomas. We examined associations between DNMTs expression and clinicopathological features or promoter methylation status of TSGs. Results Overexpression of DNMTs was detected in pituitary adenomas. Frequencies of DNMT1 overexpression were significantly higher in macroadenomas, invasive tumors, and grade III and IV tumors. DNMT3A was frequently detected in invasive tumors and grade IV tumors. In addition, DNMT1 and DNMT3A were frequently detected in high-methylation tumors. Furthermore, in multivariate logistic regression, the significant association between DNMT1 or DNMT3A and high-methylation status persisted after adjusting for clinicopathological features. Conclusions Our findings suggested that tumor overexpression of DNMT1 and DNMT3A is associated with tumor aggressive behavior and high-methylation status in pituitary adenomas. Our data support a possible role of DNMT1 and DNMT3A in TSG promoter methylation leading to pituitary adenoma invasion and suggest that inhibition of DNMTs has the potential to become a new therapeutic approach for invasive pituitary adenoma.",

        "abstract": "A minimum threshold of the serum P value on the day of ET that needs to be reached in HRT cycles to optimize the clinical outcome is suggested. BackgroundEndometrial preparation with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the preferred regimen for clinicians due to the opportunity to schedule the day of embryo transfer and for patients due to the requirement of fewer visits for frozen-warmed embryo transfers (FET). The increasing number of FETs raises the question of the serum P levels required to optimize the pregnancy outcome on the embryo transfer day.MethodsThis prospective cohort study includes patients who underwent single euploid FET. All patients received HRT with oestradiol valerate (EV) and 100\u2009mg of intramuscular (IM) progesterone (P). FET was scheduled 117\u2013120\u2009h after the first IM administration of 100\u2009mg P. The serum P level was analyzed 1\u2009h before the embryo transfer (ET). In all cycles, only embryos that were biopsied on day 5 were utilized for FET. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was used for comprehensive chromosomal analysis.ResultsOverall, the ongoing pregnancy rate (OPR) was 58.9% (99/168). Data were then categorized according to the presence (Group I; n\u00a0=\u200999) or the absence (Group II; n\u00a0=\u200969) of an ongoing pregnancy. No significant differences regarding, female age, body mass index (BMI), number of previous miscarriages, number of previous live birth, sperm concentration, number of oocytes retrieved, number of mature oocytes (MII), rate of fertilized oocytes with two pronuclei (2PN), trophectoderm score, inner cell mass (ICM) score, endometrial thickness (mm), oestrodiol (E2) and P levels prior to IM P administration were found between two groups. The P levels on the day of ET (ng/ml) were significantly higher in Group I (28 (5.6\u201376.4) vs 16.4 (7.4\u201360) p\u00a0=\u20090.039). The P level on the day of ET was a predictor of a higher OPR (p\u00a0<\u20090.001 OR: 1.033 95%CI [1.009\u20131.056]) after multivariate analysis. The ROC curve showed a significant predictive value of serum P levels on the day of ET for OPR, with an AUC (95%CI)\u2009=\u20090.716 (0.637\u20130.795). The optimal cut-off value for prediction of the OPR was a P level of 20.6\u2009ng/ml (71.7% sensitivity, 56.5% specificity).ConclusionsThe present study suggests a minimum threshold of the serum P value on the day of ET that needs to be reached in HRT cycles to optimize the clinical outcome. Individualization of the P dosage should be evaluated in further studies.",

        "abstract": "How MSC and Th17 cells interact, communicate, and exchange information through different ways such as cell-to-cell contact, secretion of soluble factors, and organelle transfer is reviewed. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit potent immunoregulatory abilities by interacting with cells of the adaptive and innate immune system. In vitro, MSCs inhibit the differentiation of T cells into T helper 17 (Th17) cells and repress their proliferation. In vivo, the administration of MSCs to treat various experimental inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and bowel disease showed promising therapeutic results. These therapeutic properties mediated by MSCs are associated with an attenuated immune response characterized by a reduced frequency of Th17 cells and the generation of regulatory T cells. In this manuscript, we review how MSC and Th17 cells interact, communicate, and exchange information through different ways such as cell-to-cell contact, secretion of soluble factors, and organelle transfer. Moreover, we discuss the consequences of this dynamic dialogue between MSC and Th17 well described by their phenotypic and functional plasticity.",

        "abstract": "A shared genetic etiology of a subset of hereditary cardiomyopathies and cardiac arrhythmias is suggested and secondary changes in ion currents, such as post-translational modifications, are common and contributors to the pathogenesis of arrh rhythmias in cardiomeopathies through altering biophysical and functional properties of the ion channels. Cardiac arrhythmias are common, often the first, and sometimes the life-threatening manifestations of hereditary cardiomyopathies. Pathogenic variants in several genes known to cause hereditary cardiac arrhythmias have also been identified in the sporadic cases and small families with cardiomyopathies. These findings suggest a shared genetic etiology of a subset of hereditary cardiomyopathies and cardiac arrhythmias. The concept of a shared genetic etiology is in accord with the complex and exquisite interplays that exist between the ion currents and cardiac mechanical function. However, neither the causal role of cardiac arrhythmias genes in cardiomyopathies is well established nor the causal role of cardiomyopathy genes in arrhythmias. To the contrary, secondary changes in ion currents, such as post-translational modifications, are common and contributors to the pathogenesis of arrhythmias in cardiomyopathies through altering biophysical and functional properties of the ion channels. Moreover, structural changes, such as cardiac hypertrophy, dilatation, and fibrosis provide a pro-arrhythmic substrate in hereditary cardiomyopathies. Genetic basis and molecular biology of cardiac arrhythmias in hereditary cardiomyopathies are discussed.",

        "abstract": "This is the first study to show that CM from immortalized SHEDs exerts therapeutic effects on PU formation by promoting angiogenesis and oxidative stress resistance through vascular endothelial growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor. Pressure ulcers (PUs) are increasing with aging worldwide, but there is no effective causal therapy. Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) promote cutaneous wound healing, the effects of the conditioned medium (CM) of MSCs on cutaneous PU formation induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury have been poorly investigated. To address this issue, herein, we first established an immortalized stem cell line from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED). This cell line was revealed to have superior characteristics in that it grows infinitely and vigorously, and stably and consistently secretes a variety of cytokines. Using the CM obtained from the immortalized SHED cell line, we investigated the therapeutic potential on a cutaneous ischemia-reperfusion mouse model for PU formation using two magnetic plates. This is the first study to show that CM from immortalized SHEDs exerts therapeutic effects on PU formation by promoting angiogenesis and oxidative stress resistance through vascular endothelial growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor. Thus, the CM of MSCs has potent therapeutic effects, whereas these therapies have not been implemented in human medicine. To try to meet the regulatory requirements for manufacturing and quality control as much as possible, it is necessary to produce CM that is consistently safe and effective. The immortalization of stem cells could be one of the breakthroughs to meet the regulatory requirements and consequently open up a novel avenue to create a novel type of cell-free regenerative medicine, although further investigation into the quality control is warranted.",

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) provide not only cell sources for connective tissues but also the control of hematopoiesis and immune response. A multitude of cytokines and growth factors secreted from MSCs are known to confer such multifunctional functionality, but their overall spectrum and the respective expression strength have not been thoroughly illustrated. In this study, we have obtained the comprehensive cytokine secretion profile of human bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs, with the use of an antibody array recognizing 120 cytokines and chemokines. The array membrane incubated with the secretion media of the cells featured a predominant hybridization signal for IL-6 and moderately elevated signals for IL-8, TIMP-2, MCP-1, VEGF and OPG. This cytokine secretion profile was found to be common to all cell lines from three different donors, and also similar but not identical to that of umbilical cord blood-derived cells, suggesting that the trophic nature of the MSCs might depend slightly on the cell origin but not on individuality of the donors. Our results here may provide the molecular basis for further studies on MSC-assisted biological processes, such as connective tissue homeostasis, hematopoiesis and immune modulation.",

Choroidal melanoma (CM), despite its rarity, is the most frequent intraocular malignancy. Over time, several histological variants of CM have been distinguished, including spindle A and B cell, fascicular, epithelioid and necrotic type. However, they have been progressively abandoned as having no prognostic value and currently, the American Joint Committee of Cancer (AJCC) classification identifies three CM cell types: spindle, epithelioid and mixed cell type. Other rare histological variants of CM include: (i) diffuse melanoma; (ii) clear cell; and (iii) balloon cell melanoma. Immunohistochemically, CMs are stained with Human Melanoma Black 45 (HMB45) antigen, S-100 protein, Melan-A (also known as melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1/MART-1), melanocyte inducing transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase, vimentin, and Sex determining region Y-Box 10 (SOX10). Several genetic and histopathological prognostic factors of CM have been reported in the literature, including epithelioid cell type, TNM staging, extraocular extension, monosomy 3 and 6p gain and loss of BAP-1 gene. The aim of this review was to summarize the histopathological, immunohistochemical and genetic features of CM, establishing \u201cthe state of the art\u201d and providing colleagues with practical tools to promptly deal with patients affected by this rare malignant neoplasm.",

        "abstract": "An updated overview of adult multipotent stem cells is provided and new possibilities introduced by the generation of iPSCs in domestic animals are discussed, highlighting the possibility of generating gametes in vitro via PGCL induction. Stem cells are undifferentiated and self-renewable cells that present new possibilities for both regenerative medicine and the understanding of early mammalian development. Adult multipotent stem cells are already widely used worldwide in human and veterinary medicine, and their therapeutic signalling, particularly with respect to immunomodulation, and their trophic properties have been intensively studied. The derivation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from domestic species, however, has been challenging, and the poor results do not reflect the successes obtained in mouse and human experiments. More recently, the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) via the forced expression of specific transcription factors has been demonstrated in domestic species and has introduced new potentials in regenerative medicine and reproductive science based upon the ability of these cells to differentiate into a variety of cells types in vitro. For example, iPSCs have been differentiated into primordial germ-like cells (PGC-like cells, PGCLs) and functional gametes in mice. The possibility of using iPSCs from domestic species for this purpose would contribute significantly to reproductive technologies, offering unprecedented opportunities to restore fertility, to preserve endangered species and to generate transgenic animals for biomedical applications. Therefore, this review aims to provide an updated overview of adult multipotent stem cells and to discuss new possibilities introduced by the generation of iPSCs in domestic animals, highlighting the possibility of generating gametes in vitro via PGCL induction.",

        "abstract": "This study indicates that hUCMSCs-EVs can alleviate cartilage degradation during the OA progression, mechanically may through delivering key proteins and modulating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway mediated by miRNAs to promote polarization of M2 macrophage, exhibiting potent immunomodulatory potential. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative illness that greatly impacts the life quality of patients. Currently, the therapeutic approaches for OA are very limited in clinical. The extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from different mesenchymal stem cells displayed a prominent therapeutic effect on OA. But most EVs have limited resources and the risks of host rejection, immunological response, and etc. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) hold the advantages of easy availability, minimal immune rejection, and excellent immunomodulatory effects, although hUCMSCs-EVs have seldom been applied in OA. Herein, we investigated the potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of hUCMSCs-EVs on the treatment of OA. In our results, the treatment of hUCMSCs-EVs promoted the polarization of M2-type macrophages and the expression of anti-inflammation-related cytokines (IL-10). Notably, the supernate of M2 macrophages induced by hUCMSCs-EVs inhibited the level of inflammation-associated factors in OA chondrocytes caused by IL-1\u03b2. Further, injection of hUCMSCs-EVs in the articular lumen ameliorated progression of OA and exerted chondroprotective potential based on the OA joint model created by the surgical transection of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACLT). In addition, we found five highly enriched miRNAs in hUCMSCs-EVs, including has-miR-122-5p, has-miR-148a-3p, has-miR-486-5p, has-miR-let-7a-5p, and has-miR-100-5p by High-throughput sequencing of miRNAs, with targeted genes mainly enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, we also detected the protein abundance of hUCMSCs-EVs using liquidation chromatography with tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) analysis. Thus, our study indicates that hUCMSCs-EVs can alleviate cartilage degradation during the OA progression, mechanically may through delivering key proteins and modulating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway mediated by miRNAs to promote polarization of M2 macrophage, exhibiting potent immunomodulatory potential. The current findings suggest that hUCMSCs-EVs might serve as a new reagent for the therapy of OA. Graphical Abstract",

        "abstract": "This review discusses the design and representative biomedical applications of ELPs, focusing primarily on their use in tissue engineering and drug delivery. Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are stimulus-responsive biopolymers derived from human elastin. Their unique properties-including lower critical solution temperature phase behavior and minimal immunogenicity-make them attractive materials for a variety of biomedical applications. ELPs also benefit from recombinant synthesis and genetically encoded design; these enable control over the molecular weight and precise incorporation of peptides and pharmacological agents into the sequence. Because their size and sequence are defined, ELPs benefit from exquisite control over their structure and function, qualities that cannot be matched by synthetic polymers. As such, ELPs have been engineered to assemble into unique architectures and display bioactive agents for a variety of applications. This review discusses the design and representative biomedical applications of ELPs, focusing primarily on their use in tissue engineering and drug delivery.

        "abstract": "In vitro studies report that liver organoids are a promising model for regenerative medicine, organogenesis, liver regeneration, disease modelling, drug screening and personalized treatment. The liver is the most important digestive organ in the body. Several studies have explored liver biology and diseases related to the liver. However, most of these studies have only explored liver development, mechanism of liver regeneration and pathophysiology of liver diseases mainly based on two-dimensional (2D) cell lines and animal models. Traditional 2D cell lines do not represent the complex three-dimensional tissue architecture whereas animal models are limited by inter-species differences. These shortcomings limit understanding of liver biology and diseases. Liver organoid technology is effective in elucidating structural and physiological characteristics and basic tissue-level functions of liver tissue. In this review, formation strategies and a wide range of applications in biomedicine of liver organoid are summarized. Liver organoids are derived from single type cell culture, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), adult stem cells, primary hepatocytes, and primary cholangiocytes and multi-type cells co-culture, such as iPSC-derived hepatic endoderm cells co-cultured with mesenchymal stem cells and umbilical cord-derived endothelial cells. In vitro studies report that liver organoids are a promising model for regenerative medicine, organogenesis, liver regeneration, disease modelling, drug screening and personalized treatment. Liver organoids are a promising in vitro model for basic research and for development of clinical therapeutic interventions for hepatopathy.",

        "abstract": "This computational model approach for the detection of emotional changes using dataset from EMOTIC database by recognition system achieves around 88% accuracy which efficient and better when it's been compared with computer modeling Methodologies. An essential tool for describing human emotion is facial expression. From morning tonight, people go through a broad spectrum of emotions that may be caused by their mental or physical health. The six major facial expressions of happy, sorrow, surprise, fear, disgust, and rage are now classified by psychology as six universal emotions, despite the fact that humans experience a broad variety of emotions. Facial muscle movements may be used to determine humane motions. The brow, lips, nose, and eyes are the four primary facial characteristics Facial recognition is a topic that is now the focus of much investigation. Finding a match between the input image and the images to red in the database is the aim of face recognition. Human- computer interaction and the solution to the problem of criminal identification depend on facial recognition. The data in face recognition tasks has a high intrinsic complexity, making the dimensionality reduction strategy essential. Picture space's dimensionality is decreased using PCA. In the domains of computer vision, image processing, pattern recognition and other areas, the modelling of the face using Gabor features has generated a lot of attention. The major justification for using the Gabor filter is its biological significance. Mammal primary visual cortex neurons have an accessible field profile that is oriented toward spatial frequency features. Additionally, Gabor filters may make advantage of well-known visual properties as spatial localization, orientation selectivity and spatial frequency feature. So, we are proposing this computational model approach for the detection of emotional changes using dataset from EMOTIC database by recognition system. In this approach we achieved around 88% accuracy which efficient and better when it's been compared with computer modeling Methodologies.",

        "abstract": "Change in the heart rate patterns within the studied groups supports the concept of the Trojan horse effect within the exposure to polystyrene particles with adsorbed fluoranthene. In this study, the possible 'vector effect' within the exposure of Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) to polystyrene microplastics with adsorbed fluoranthene was investigated by applying the multibiomarker approach. The major focus was placed on genotoxicological endpoints as to our knowledge there are no literature data on the genotoxicity of polystyrene microparticles alone or with adsorbed fluoranthene in the selected experimental organisms. DNA damage was assessed in haemocytes by comet assay and micronucleus test. For the assessment of neurotoxicity, acetylcholinesterase activity was measured in gills. Glutathione S-transferase was assessed in gills and hepatopancreas since these enzymes are induced for biotransformation and excretion of lipophilic compounds such as hydrocarbons. Finally, differences in physiological response within the exposure to polystyrene particles, fluoranthene, or particles with adsorbed fluoranthene were assessed by the variation of heart rate patterns studied by the noninvasive laser fibre-optic method. The uniform response of individual biomarkers within the exposure groups was not recorded. There was no clear pattern in variation of acetylcholinesterase or glutathione S-transferase activity which could be attributed to the treatment. Exposure to polystyrene increased DNA damage which was detected by the comet assay but was not confirmed by micronucleus formation. Data of genotoxicity assays indicated differential responses among the groups exposed to fluoranthene alone and fluoranthene adsorbed to polystyrene. Change in the heart rate patterns within the studied groups supports the concept of the Trojan horse effect within the exposure to polystyrene particles with adsorbed fluoranthene.",

        "abstract": "It is suggested that MT treatment may significantly attenuates the severity of EAE by altering the kynurenine pathway, AhR and NAD+ metabolism. Melatonin (MT), a neurohormone with immunomodulatory properties, is one of the metabolites produced in the brain from tryptophan (TRP) that has already strong links with the neuropathogenesis of Multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the exact molecular mechanisms behind that are not fully understood. There is some evidence showing that MS and MT are interconnected via different pathways: Relapses of MS has a direct correlation with a low level of MT secretion and a growing body of evidence suggest that MT be therapeutic in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE, a recognise animal model of MS) severity. Previous studies have demonstrated that the kynurenine pathway (KP), the main pathway of TRP catabolism, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of MS in humans and in EAE. The present study aimed to investigate whether MT can improve clinical signs in the EAE model by modulating the KP. C57BL/6 mice were induced with EAE and received different doses of MT. Then the onset and severity of EAE clinical symptoms were recorded. Two biological factors, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and NAD+ which closely interact in the KP were also assessed. The results indicated that MT treatment at all tested doses significantly decrease the EAE clinical scores and the number of demyelinating plaques. Furthermore, MT treatment reduced the mRNA expression of the KP regulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1(IDO-1) and other KP enzymes. We also found that MT treatment reduces the mRNA expression of the AhR and inhibits the enzyme Nicotinamide N-Methyltransferase (Nnmt) overexpression leading to an increase in NAD+\u2009levels. Collectively, this study suggests that MT treatment may significantly attenuates the severity of EAE by altering the KP, AhR and NAD+ metabolism.",

Osteoclasts (OCs) are important cells that are involved in the regulation of bone metabolism and are mainly responsible for coordinating bone resorption with bone formation to regulate bone remodeling. The imbalance between bone resorption and formation significantly affects bone metabolism. When the activity of osteoclasts exceeds the osteoblasts, it results in a condition called osteoporosis, which is characterized by reduced bone microarchitecture, decreased bone mass, and increased occurrences of fracture. Molecules, including transcription factors, proteins, hormones, nucleic acids, such as non-coding RNAs, play an important role in osteoclast proliferation, differentiation, and function. In this review, we have highlighted the role of these molecules in osteoclasts regulation and osteoporosis. The developed therapeutics targeting these molecules for the treatment of osteoporosis in recent years have also been discussed with challenges faced in clinical application.",

        "abstract": "The domestic pig has emerged as a particularly suitable model for the creation of human disease models and the development of novel stem cell therapies and the progress made is reviewed. Pluripotent stem cells possess the unique capacity to proliferate indefinitely in culture and to differentiate into cells of the three germ layers, the endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm. These important features render pluripotent stem cells ideal for both, basic studies in developmental biology and biomedical research in farm animals. Pluripotent cells can serve as a valuable tool for complex genetic modifications with the goal to improve production traits, disease resistance or for the creation of human disease models. The domestic pig shares many genetic, anatomical and physiological similarities with humans and thus has emerged as a particularly suitable model for the creation of human disease models and the development of novel stem cell therapies. Porcine germ line competent pluripotent stem cell lines have not yet been established, neither from early embryos (embryonic stem cells), nor from fetuses (fetal stem cells) or adult tissue (adult stem cells). Here, we review the progress made in the derivation and characterization of pluripotent stem cell lines from pigs.",

        "abstract": "It is suggested that DNMT1 may not have a specific role in inhibiting CDH1 gene expression in APL, and higher resolution techniques would help to better uncover the DNA methylation patterns in patients with APL. Background\nDNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that has the ability to alter gene expression and function. These epigenetic changes have been associated with the development of cancer. Previous research has found that DNA methylation patterns can predict disease prognosis for patients with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL). The role of DNMT1 and CDH1 in regulating the extension of cells are studied in this study.\n\n\nMethods\nDNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of APL patients and treated with bisulfite. DNMT1 and CDH1 gene promoter methylation was subsequently analyzed using methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Real-time PCR was used to measure the expression level of DNMT1 and CDH1 genes.\n\n\nResults\nPartial methylation of the CDH1 gene promoter was detected in 20% of APL patients and an unmethylated status was detected in 80% of patient samples. Additionally, an unmethylated status in the DNMT1 gene promoter was detected in 100% of APL patient samples.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur study found the CDH1 gene promoter to be unmethylated in almost all APL patients, while the DNMT1 promoter was unmethylated in all APL patients. Furthermore, we observed an increase in both CDH1 and DNMT1 gene expression in APL patients compared to healthy controls. These findings suggest that DNMT1 may not have a specific role in inhibiting CDH1 gene expression in APL. Applying higher resolution techniques would help to better uncover the DNA methylation patterns in patients with APL. Further research is required to determine the role of DNA methylation and CDH1 and DNMT1 gene expression in APL.",

        "abstract": "The results showed that the lumbar BMD was negatively associated with HU in obesity, however, such findings only existed in men, rather than women, and no significant relationship between hip BMD and HU existed in obesity. Background Obesity is an increasingly severe global public health issue. This study aims to estimate the cross-sectional association between bone mineral density (BMD) and hyperuricemia (HU) in obesity. Method A total of 275 obese subjects (126 men and 149 women) participated in this cross-sectional study. Obesity was diagnosed as body mass index (BMI) \u226528 kg/m2, whereas HU was defined as the blood uric acid level of 416 \u03bcmol/L in men and 360 \u03bcmol/L in women. The BMD of the lumbar spine and right hip was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The multivariable logistic regressions were employed to examine the relationship between BMD and HU in obesity, with the adjustment of gender, age, fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), cigarette smoking, and alcohol drinking status. Result The overall prevalence of HU was 66.9% in this obese population. The mean age and BMI of this population were 27.9 \u00b1 9.9 years and 35.2 \u00b1 5.2 kg/m2, respectively. The multivariable-adjusted OR (the highest vs. lowest BMD quartile) demonstrated a negative relationship between BMD and HU in total (OR = 0.415, 95%CI: 0.182\u20130.946; p = 0.036), L1 (OR = 0.305, 95%CI: 0.127\u20130.730; p = 0.008), L2 (OR = 0.405, 95%CI: 0.177\u20130.925; p = 0.032), and L3 (OR = 0.368, 95%CI: 0.159\u20130.851; p = 0.020) lumbar vertebrae. In the subgroup analysis for the male population, the BMD was also negatively associated with HU in total (OR = 0.077, 95%CI: 0.014\u20130.427; p = 0.003), L1 (OR = 0.019, 95%CI: 0.002\u20130.206; p = 0.001), L2 (OR = 0.161, 95%CI: 0.034\u20130.767; p = 0.022), L3 (OR = 0.186, 95%CI: 0.041\u20130.858; p = 0.031), and L4 (OR = 0.231, 95%CI: 0.056\u20130.948; p = 0.042) lumbar vertebrae. However, such findings did not exist in women. In addition, there was no significant relationship between hip BMD and HU in obesity. Conclusion Our results showed that the lumbar BMD was negatively associated with HU in obesity. However, such findings only existed in men, rather than women. In addition, no significant relationship between hip BMD and HU existed in obesity. Due to the limited sample size and nature of the cross-sectional design, further large prospective studies are still needed to clarify the issues.",

        "abstract": "Progesterone levels remained significantly different after logistic regression on age and anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) level and the lower serum progesterone level found on FET day in the AC group should be further investigated to see whether this difference has a clinical effect on the live birth rate. The live birth rate following embryo transfer is comparable between spontaneous, stimulated and artificial cycles. However, the pregnancy loss rate appears elevated with hormonal therapy, possibly due to luteal insufficiency. This study aimed to determine whether the serum progesterone level on transfer day differed according to the endometrial preparation method for frozen embryo transfer (FET). Twenty spontaneous cycles (SC), 27 ovarian stimulation cycles (OS) and 65 artificial cycles (AC) were retrospectively studied from May to December 2019 in a single French hospital. The primary endpoint was the level of serum progesterone on the day of FET between the three endometrial preparation methods. The mean serum progesterone level on transfer day was 29.47 ng/ml in the OS group versus 20.03 ng/ml in the SC group and 14.32 ng/ml AC group (P < 0.0001). Progesterone levels remained significantly different after logistic regression on age and anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) level. There was no significant difference in demographic and hormone characteristics (age, body mass index, embryo stage of embryo, type of infertility, basal follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol and AMH levels), endometrial thickness, number and type of embryos transferred, duration of infertility, pregnancy rate, live birth rate and pregnancy loss rate. No difference was found in serum progesterone levels between clinical pregnancy with fetal heartbeat and no clinical pregnancy (no pregnancy or pregnancy loss, 17.49 ng/ml vs 20.83 ng/ml, respectively, P = 0.07). The lower serum progesterone level found on FET day in the AC group should be further investigated to see whether this difference has a clinical effect on the live birth rate.",

Malignant tumor tissues exhibit inter- and intratumoral heterogeneities, aberrant development, dynamic stromal composition, diverse tissue phenotypes, and cell populations growing within localized mechanical stresses in hypoxic conditions. Experimental tumor models employing engineered systems that isolate and study these complex variables using in vitro techniques are under development as complementary methods to preclinical in vivo models. Here, advances in extrusion bioprinting as an enabling technology to recreate the three-dimensional tumor milieu and its complex heterogeneous characteristics are reviewed. Extrusion bioprinting allows for the deposition of multiple materials, or selected cell types and concentrations, into models based upon physiological features of the tumor. This affords the creation of complex samples with representative extracellular or stromal compositions that replicate the biology of patient tissue. Biomaterial engineering of printable materials that replicate specific features of the tumor microenvironment offer experimental reproducibility, throughput, and physiological relevance compared to animal models. In this review, we describe the potential of extrusion-based bioprinting to recreate the tumor microenvironment within in vitro models.",

        "abstract": "The various mechanisms of MSCs during tissue healing signals, their interaction with the immune system, and the impact of their lifespan in the management of osteoarthritis of the knee are highlighted. Cellular therapy offers regeneration which curbs osteoarthritis of the knee. Among cellular therapies, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are readily isolated from various sources as culture expanded and unexpanded cellular population which are used as therapeutic products. Though MSCs possess a unique immunological and regulatory profile through cross-talk between MSCs and immunoregulatory cells (T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, B cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages), they provide an immunotolerant environment when transplanted to the site of action. Immunophenotypic profile allows MSCs to escape immune surveillance and promotes their hypoimmunogenic or immune-privileged status. MSCs do not elicit a proliferative response when co-cultured with allogeneic T cells in vitro. MSCs secrete a wide range of anti-inflammatory mediators such as PGE-2, IDO, IL-1Ra, and IL-10. They also stimulate the resilient chondrogenic progenitors and enhance the chondrocyte differentiation by secretion of BMPs and TGF\u03b21. We highlight the various mechanisms of MSCs during tissue healing signals, their interaction with the immune system, and the impact of their lifespan in the management of osteoarthritis of the knee. A better understanding of the immunobiology of MSC renders them as an efficient therapeutic product for the management of osteoarthritis of the knee.",

        "title": "Inherited conditions of arrhythmia: translating disease mechanisms to patient management",
        "abstract": "The current state of the art for the various inherited arrhythmia disorders is highlighted, novel targets for risk stratification and therapy are reviewed, and the remaining challenges and future perspectives are described. Inherited arrhythmias may be caused by mutations in genes encoding cardiac ion channels and associated proteins (primary electrical disorders), and may occur in the setting of hereditary cardiomyopathies secondary to mutations in cardiac structural proteins. Together, they may contribute to up to 15\u201320% of all sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs). Progress in genetic, molecular, and (electro)physiological aspects of inherited arrhythmia disorders has enabled the identification of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. However, insight into disease mechanisms and arrhythmia triggers is still limited, precluding the development of mechanism-driven therapies. In addition, inherited arrhythmia syndromes are often associated with reduced penetrance and variability in disease expressivity and severity. Hence, predicting who is most at risk for SCD remains difficult. In this Spotlight Issue, a series of reviews highlight the current state of the art for the various inherited arrhythmia disorders, review novel targets for risk stratification and therapy, and describe the remaining challenges and future perspectives. In line with their role in action potential formation, mutations in ion channel genes are well-established causes of inherited arrhythmia syndromes associated with altered depolarization and/or repolarization. A wide range of molecularly diverse potassium channels are present in the myocardium, which together maintain the resting membrane potential and mediate action potential repolarization. Mutations in genes encoding these channels can impair their assembly, trafficking, and gating, leading to long QT syndrome types and 2 (LQTS1, LQTS2), short QT syndrome (SQTS), J wave syndromes, and atrial fibrillation. As discussed by Crotti et al., mechanism-based therapies are largely missing for these disorders, despite extensive knowledge on their genetic and molecular basis. In the last decade, transgenic rabbit LQTS/SQTS models (which show more similarities to human cardiac repolarization than for instance mice) have provided valuable mechanistic insight into arrhythmia mechanisms, including the role of dispersion of repolarization, electromechanical remodelling, sympathetic activity, and hormones. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) and zebrafish models are furthermore enabling identification and testing of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at allele-specific RNA interference, modulation of ion currents, or rescue of trafficking-deficient channels. In addition to potassium channelopathies, mutations in the SCN5A gene encoding the cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5 also cause a broad spectrum of inherited arrhythmia disorders, including long QT syndrome type 3 (LQTS3), Brugada syndrome (BrS), cardiac conduction disease, atrial fibrillation, and sick sinus syndrome. In their review, Rivaud et al. discuss the multifunctionality of sodium channels and propose a novel classification of NaV1.5 (dys)function. 5 Reduced peak sodium current or increased late sodium current (\u2018direct ionic\u2019 effects) consequent to SCN5A mutations are well-established causes of pro-arrhythmic conduction slowing and repolarization disturbances, respectively. However, cardiac abnormalities are increasingly reported in SCN5A mutation carriers, including cardiac fibrosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmogenic (right ventricular) cardiomyopathy (ACM/ARVC). Such structural remodelling may occur consequent to alterations in intracellular sodium and calcium homeostasis (\u2018indirect ionic\u2019 effects), or secondary to disrupted interactions of NaV1.5 with partner proteins within the macromolecular complex (\u2018non-ionic\u2019 effects). Since these non-canonical actions of NaV1.5 may contribute significantly to arrhythmogenesis, they clearly warrant further exploration. In addition to ion channelopathies, arrhythmias and SCD also occur in the setting of hereditary cardiomyopathies, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), and left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC). As reviewed by Marian et al., these cardiomyopathies are predominantly caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins (HCM), cytoskeletal proteins (DCM), and desmosomal proteins (ACM). Pro-arrhythmic mechanisms include cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation, myocardial fibrosis, ion channel and connexin remodelling, and intracellular calcium dysregulation. Interestingly, mutations in a number of genes encoding ion channels or transporters, including SCN5A, HCN4, PLN (phospholamban), and RYR2 (ryanodine receptor 2) have been associated with DCM, ACM, and/or LVNC. Conversely, mutations in the LMNA gene encoding lamin A/C lead to cardiac conduction defects and",

        "abstract": "A wide variety of ocular lesions may mimic choroid melanoma, which should be included in the differential diagnosis of choroidal nevus and peripheral hemorrhages, which usually occur in males, clear-eyed, and older individuals. Introduction: Melanomas are malignant neoplasms that occur in various anatomical sites, including the eye. Ocular melanomas account for 5% of all melanomas and are mainly described in Caucasian and older individuals. This study describes the clinical and pathological characteristics of uveal (choroid) melanoma in a Caucasian patient. Case report: A 41-year-old Caucasian female patient, brown eyes, without history of ophthalmological diseases or family history of cancer experienced pain and loss of visual acuity in the left eye. On clinical examination, an increase of ocular pressure was detected. Ultrasound showed a mushroom-like neoformation. Moreover, magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass with spontaneous hypersignal on T1-weighted images, intense gadolinium enhancement, and marked hyposignal on T2-weighted images. The patient was referred to the Oncology Ophthalmology department for enucleation due to suspected uveal melanoma. Anatomopathological analysis revealed a blackened mass in the eyeball. Histologically, the mass comprised spindle cells (50%) and epithelioid cells (50%). A diagnosis of choroidal melanoma was established based on the identification of ophthalmoscopic, imaging, and histological characteristics of the tumor. Conclusion: Choroidal melanomas usually occur in males, clear-eyed, and older individuals. A wide variety of ocular lesions may mimic choroidal melanoma, which should be included in the differential diagnosis of choroidal nevus and peripheral hemorrhages.",

        "abstract": "The generation of iPS cells in domestic animals is presented, and an important contribution of stem cells aiming the correction of infertility, the conservation of species in risk of extinction and for the generation of genetically superior or modified organisms for agricultural and biomedical applications is focused on. Stem cells are widely known for their high potential for self-renewal, being classified according to their stage of undifferentiation and epigenetic profile. Embryonic stem cells (ES) and adult stem cells are already well studied and characterized, mainly in human and mouse models, once they present new possibilities both for regenerative medicine and for understanding the initial development of mammals. However, the derivation and maintenance of ES in domestic species is challenging and presents inconsistent results regarding maintenance of in vitro pluripotency. In this context, the derivation of in vitro induced pluripotent cells (iPS cells or iPSCs) enables new possibilities in regenerative and reproductive veterinary medicine due to their ability to differentiate into a variety of other cell types. Therefore, this review presents the generation of iPS cells in domestic animals, and focuses on recent studies on the steps necessary for the generation of functional gametes in vitro, an important contribution of stem cells aiming the correction of infertility, the conservation of species in risk of extinction and for the generation of genetically superior or modified organisms for agricultural and biomedical applications.",

        "abstract": "The novel regulatory functions of MSC-EVs from different sources in the activities of innate and adaptive immune cells like macrophages, granulocytes, mast cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and lymphocytes are discussed. Various intractable inflammatory diseases caused by disorders of immune systems have pressed heavily on public health. Innate and adaptive immune cells as well as secreted cytokines and chemokines are commanders to mediate our immune systems. Therefore, restoring normal immunomodulatory responses of immune cells is crucial for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Mesenchymal stem cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are nano-sized double-membraned vesicles acting as paracrine effectors of MSCs. MSC-EVs, containing a variety of therapeutic agents, have shown great potential in immune modulation. Herein, we discuss the novel regulatory functions of MSC-EVs from different sources in the activities of innate and adaptive immune cells like macrophages, granulocytes, mast cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and lymphocytes. Then, we summarize the latest clinical trials of MSC-EVs in inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, we prospect the research trend of MSC-EVs in the field of immune modulation. Despite the fact that the research on the role of MSC-EVs in regulating immune cells is in infancy, this cell-free therapy based on MSC-EVs still offers a promising solution for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.",

        "abstract": "This review aims to shed some light on the main advances in elastin-like-based nanomaterials, their possible expression forms, and importance to the medical field. Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are biopolymers formed by amino acid sequences derived from tropoelastin. These biomolecules can be soluble below critical temperatures, forming aggregates at higher temperatures, which makes them an interesting source for the design of different nanobiomaterials. These nanobiomaterials can be obtained from heterologous expression in several organisms such as bacteria, fungi, and plants. Thanks to the many advantages of ELPs, they have been used in the biomedical field to develop nanoparticles, nanofibers, and nanocomposites. These nanostructures can be used in multiple applications such as drug delivery systems, treatments of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, tissue repair, and cancer therapy. Thus, this review aims to shed some light on the main advances in elastin-like-based nanomaterials, their possible expression forms, and importance to the medical field.",

        "abstract": "The current review summarizes the importance of 3D hepatic organoid culture over other conventional 2D and 3D culture models and its applicability in Liver tissue engineering. Liver-associated diseases and tissue engineering approaches based on in vitro culture of functional Primary human hepatocytes (PHH) had been restricted by the rapid de-differentiation in 2D culture conditions which restricted their usability. It was proven that cells growing in 3D format can better mimic the in vivo microenvironment, and thus help in maintaining metabolic activity, phenotypic properties, and longevity of the in vitro cultures. Again, the culture method and type of cell population are also recognized as important parameters for functional maintenance of primary hepatocytes. Hepatic organoids formed by self-assembly of hepatic cells are microtissues, and were able to show long-term in vitro maintenance of hepato-specific characteristics. Thus, hepatic organoids were recognized as an effective tool for screening potential cures and modeling liver diseases effectively. The current review summarizes the importance of 3D hepatic organoid culture over other conventional 2D and 3D culture models and its applicability in Liver tissue engineering.",

Emotions make up a key feature of conduct in human beings which aids in communication. Non-verbal communication aids in deciphering verbal communication. Non-verbal communication includes body language, facial gestures, hand postures etc., out of which facial expressions give 55% effect of what is being communicated. Humans experience many emotions which have been classified into six main emotions i.e., Sadness, Happiness, Anger, Disgust, Fear, and Surprise. Humans have a spontaneous and innate ability to understand facial gestures and construe the emotion. The same activity proves to be a great challenge for computer systems. Analyzing the facial features and perceiving the emotions is difficult due to their inconsistency. Many fields are interested in detecting human emotions using systems. In this project, we are training the model on the FER 2013 dataset. The image of a person is captured in real-time and the percentage of emotions the person depicts is plotted using a bar graph.",

Emotion Detection through Facial feature recognition is an active domain of research in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). Humans are able to share multiple emotions and feelings through their facial gestures and body language. In this project, in order to detect the live emotions from the human facial gesture, we will be using an algorithm that allows the computer to automatically detect the facial recognition of human emotions with the help of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and OpenCV. Ultimately, Emotion Detection is an integration of obtained information from multiple patterns. If computers will be able to understand more of human emotions, then it will mutually reduce the gap between humans and computers. In this research paper, we will demonstrate an effective way to detect emotions like neutral, happy, sad, surprise, angry, fear, and disgust from the frontal facial expression of the human in front of the live webcam.",

ABSTRACT The microplastic \u201cvector effect\u201d has received increasing attention. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of polyethylene microplastic beads (PE MP) on accumulation and associated oxidative stress responses attributed to fluoranthene (Flu) in blue mussels, Mytilus edulis. Blue mussels were exposed for 96 h to four treatment groups: Flu-only, MP-only, Flu and MP coexposure, and Flu-incubated MP. Treatments were conducted at a low and high concentration (50 \u03bcg/L and 100 Flu \u03bcg/L and 100, and 1000 MP/mL). Results demonstrated that in both the gill and digestive gland, coexposure did not markedly affect Flu uptake, but this treatment significantly decreased tissue Flu concentrations. Antioxidant responses including activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidases (GPx), and levels of total glutathione (GSH) in both gills and digestive glands were significantly altered suggesting a perturbation of redox state induced by the exposure conditions. Although individual biomarkers varied, the biomarker profile enabled certain generalizations to be made. Antioxidant responses occurred more likely in gill tissue than in digestive gland. Individual contaminant exposures to Flu or MP led to varying responses, but coexposures and incubated exposures did not result in additive or synergistic effects. Exposure concentrations (i.e., low or high treatments) were not a consistent a predictor of response; and the internal Flu dose did not consistently predict outcome of various biomarkers. Importantly, MP-only exposure appeared to be capable of eliciting direct effects on the oxidative stress system as demonstrated by the activities of CAT and GPx. These findings warrant further investigation.",

        "abstract": "An essential role for AhR is highlighted in microglial phagocytosis of microglia via SYK and the therapeutic potential of AhR in demyelinating diseases is suggested. AhR regulates remyelination following cuprizone-induced demyelination. Deletion of AhR in adult microglia restrains efficient remyelination. Microglial AhR deficiency causes myelin debris accumulation and impairs phagocytic function. Microglial AhR mediates phagocytosis of microglia via SYK. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Although studies have demonstrated that microglia facilitate remyelination in demyelinating diseases, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully characterized. We found that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), an environment sensor, was upregulated within the corpus callosum in the cuprizone model of CNS demyelination, and upregulated AhR was mainly confined to microglia. Deletion of AhR in adult microglia inhibited efficient remyelination. Transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq revealed that AhR-deficient microglia displayed impaired gene expression signatures associated with lysosome and phagocytotic pathways. Furthermore, AhR-deficient microglia showed impaired clearance of myelin debris and defected phagocytic capacity. Further investigation of target genes of AhR revealed that spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is the downstream effector of AhR and mediated the phagocytic capacity of microglia. Additionally, AhR deficiency in microglia aggravated CNS inflammation during demyelination. Altogether, our study highlights an essential role for AhR in microglial phagocytic function and suggests the therapeutic potential of AhR in demyelinating diseases. Graphical Abstract",

        "abstract": "To develop a safe, synergistic, effective, and homogenized TCM formula with robust scientific evidence to provide faster and more economical alternatives, the anti-osteoporosis ingredients and pharmacological mechanisms of kidney tonifying traditional Chinese medicine are recapitulated from the perspective of molecular and cell biology. The aging global population is increasingly affected by osteoporosis (OP), which is one of the most significant threats to the elderly. Moreover, its prevention and treatment situations have become increasingly severe. Therefore, it is imperative to develop alternatives or complementary drugs for preventing and treating osteoporosis. Kidney tonifying traditional Chinese medicine (KTTCM) has been used for the treatment of osteoporosis for a long time. Pharmacological studies have shown that kidney tonifying traditional Chinese medicine can promote osteoblasts, inhibit osteoclasts, and regulate the level of estrogen and plays vital roles in stimulating osteogenesis, restraining adipogenesis of marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), regulating the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus, and inhibiting oxidative stress. These effects are mediated by OPG/RANKL/RANK, BMP/Smads, MAPKs, and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin systems. To develop a safe, synergistic, effective, and homogenized TCM formula with robust scientific evidence to provide faster and more economical alternatives, the anti-osteoporosis ingredients and pharmacological mechanisms of kidney tonifying traditional Chinese medicine are recapitulated from the perspective of molecular and cell biology, and the safety and toxicity of kidney tonifying traditional Chinese medicine have also been reviewed in this paper.",

        "abstract": "Embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cell lines with the capacity of self\u2010renewal and a broad differentiation plasticity. They are derived from pre\u2010implantation embryos and can be propagated as a homogeneous, uncommitted cell population for an almost unlimited period of time without losing their pluripotency and their stable karyotype. Murine ES cells are able to reintegrate fully into embryogenesis when returned into an early embryo, even after extensive genetic manipulation. In the resulting chimeric offspring produced by blastocyst injection or morula aggregation, ES cell descendants are represented among all cell types, including functional gametes. Therefore, mouse ES cells represent an important tool for genetic engineering, in particular via homologous recombination, to introduce gene knock\u2010outs and other precise genomic modifications into the mouse germ line. Because of these properties ES cell technology is of high interest for other model organisms and for livestock species like cattle and pigs. However, in spite of tremendous research activities, no proven ES cells colonizing the germ line have yet been established for vertebrate species other than the mouse ( Evans and Kaufman, 1981 ; Martin, 1981 ) and chicken ( Pain et al., 1996 ).",

Activating transcription factor (ATF-3) is a stress response gene and is induced by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) in breast cancer cells. In this study, we dissected the functional role of ATF-3 gene in vitro by knocking down its expression stably in human bone metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231). Knockdown of ATF-3 expression in these cells decreased cell number, altered cell cycle phase transition, and decreased mRNA expression of cell cycle genes. Knockdown of ATF-3 expression in MDA-MB231 cells also decreased cell migration, and the expression levels of invasive and metastatic genes such as MMP-13 and Runx2 were found to be decreased in these cells. Most importantly, ATF-3 was associated with Runx2 promoter in MDA-MB231 cells and knockdown of ATF-3 expression decreased its association with Runx2 promoter. Hence, our results suggested that ATF-3 plays a role in proliferation and invasion of bone metastatic breast cancer cells in vitro and we identified for the first time that Runx2 is a target gene of ATF-3 in MDA-MB231 cell line.",

DNMT1, as a critical enzyme affecting epigenetics through methylation of DNA cytosine-rich sequences, regulates gene expression. Exterior factors including long-term infections, in this study Helicobacter pylori infection, could change host cells' epigenetics by affecting DNMT1 gene expression. This study investigated the statistical correlation between H. pylori virulence genes and DNMT1 gene expression in gastric antral epithelial cells of gastric adenocarcinoma and gastritis patients. In a case-control study, 50 and 53 gastritis and gastric adenocarcinoma antral biopsies, including 23 and 21 patients with H. pylori infection, respectively, were collected from hospitals in the west of Iran. Having extracted total RNA from gastric biopsy samples, cDNA was synthesized and virulence genes of H. pylori were detected by using the PCR method. Relative real-time RT PCR was used to detect \u0394\u0394Ct fold changes of the DNMT1 gene expression in divided groups of patients based on H. pylori infection and clinical manifestations. The results showed that along with increasing patients' age, the DNMT1 gene expression will increase in gastric antral epithelial cells of gastric cancer patients (P \u2264 0.05). On the other hand, the biopsy samples with infection of H. pylori cagA, cagY, and cagE genotypes revealed a direct correlation along with increased DNMT1 gene expression.

        "abstract": "Higher serum UA levels are associated with low BMD at different skeletal sites in Mexican females, and a longitudinal association between UA and loss of B MD at different sites is observed. Background: Inconsistent epidemiological evidence between uric acid (UA) and bone mineral density (BMD) has been observed. Therefore, we evaluated the association between UA and BMD in Mexican adults. Methods: This analysis was conducted on 1423 participants from the Health Workers Cohort Study. We explored cross-sectional associations using linear regression and longitudinal associations using fixed-effects linear regression by sex and age groups (<45 and \u226545 years). Results: In females <45 years old, the cross-sectional analysis showed that UA levels were positively associated with total hip BMD. However, in the longitudinal analysis, we observed a negative association with the femoral neck and lumbar spine BMD. In contrast, in males <45 years old, we found an increase in total hip and femoral neck BMD in the groups with high levels of UA in the longitudinal association. On the other hand, in females \u226545 years old, we observed a longitudinal association between UA and loss of BMD at different sites. We did not observe an association between UA levels and BMD in males \u226545 years old. Conclusions: Our results suggest higher serum UA levels are associated with low BMD at different skeletal sites in Mexican females. Further studies are needed to delineate the underlying mechanisms behind this observation.",

        "title": "Impact of low serum progesterone levels on the day of embryo transfer on pregnancy outcome: a prospective cohort study in artificial cycles with vaginal progesterone.",
        "abstract": "The threshold of serum P levels is identified as 8.8\u2009ng/ml on the day of ET for artificial endometrial preparation cycles necessary to optimize outcomes, in cycles with own or donated oocytes. STUDY QUESTION\nIs there a serum progesterone (P) threshold on the day of embryo transfer (ET) in artificial endometrium preparation cycles below which the chances of ongoing pregnancy are reduced?\n\n\nSUMMARY ANSWER\nSerum P levels <8.8\u2009ng/ml on the day of ET lower ongoing pregnancy rate (OPR) in both own or donated oocyte cycles.\n\n\nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY\nWe previously found that serum P levels <9.2\u2009ng/ml on the day of ET significantly decrease OPR in a sample of 211 oocyte donation recipients. Here, we assessed whether these results are applicable to all infertile patients under an artificial endometrial preparation cycle, regardless of the oocyte origin.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION\nThis prospective cohort study was performed between September 2017 and November 2018 and enrolled 1205 patients scheduled for ET after an artificial endometrial preparation cycle with estradiol valerate and micronized vaginal P (MVP, 400\u2009mg twice daily).\n\n\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS\nPatients \u226450\u2009years old with a triple-layer endometrium \u22656.5\u2009mm underwent transfer of one or two blastocysts. A total of 1150 patients treated with own oocytes without preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidies (PGT-A) (n\u2009=\u2009184), own oocytes with PGT-A (n\u2009=\u2009308) or donated oocytes (n\u2009=\u2009658) were analyzed. The primary endpoint was the OPR beyond pregnancy week 12 based on serum P levels measured immediately before ET.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE\nWomen with serum P levels <8.8\u2009ng/ml (30th percentile) had a significantly lower OPR (36.6% vs 54.4%) and live birth rate (35.5% vs 52.0%) than the rest of the patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed that serum P\u2009<\u20098.8\u2009ng/ml was an independent factor influencing OPR in the overall population and in the three treatment groups. A significant negative correlation was observed between serum P levels and BMI, weight and time between the last P dose and blood tests and a positive correlation was found with age, height and number of days on HRT. Multivariate logistic regression showed that only body weight was an independent factor for presenting serum P levels <8.8\u2009ng/ml. Obstetrical and perinatal outcomes did not differ in patients with ongoing pregnancy regardless of serum P levels being above/below 8.8\u2009ng/ml.\n\n\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION\nOnly women with MVP were included. Extrapolation to other P administration forms needs to be validated.\n\n\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS\nThis study identified the threshold of serum P as 8.8\u2009ng/ml on the day of ET for artificial endometrial preparation cycles necessary to optimize outcomes, in cycles with own or donated oocytes. One-third of patients receiving MVP show inadequate levels of serum P that, in turn, impact the success of the ART cycle. Monitoring P levels in the mid-luteal phase is recommended when using MVP to adjust the doses according to the needs of the patient.\n\n\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S)\nNone.\n\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER\nNCT03272412.",

        "abstract": "This review highlights the recent developments in 3D cancer modeling using different bioprinting techniques to recreate the tumor microenvironment and showcases the 3D drug-tumor interaction and further utilization of such models to develop personalized medicine. The tumor microenvironment (TME) typically comprises cancer cells, tumor vasculature, stromal components like fibroblasts, and host immune cells that assemble to support tumorigenesis. However, preexisting classic cancer models like 2D cell culture methods, 3D cancer spheroids, and tumor organoids seem to lack essential TME components. 3D bioprinting offers enormous advantages for developing in vitro tumor models by allowing user-controlled deposition of multiple biomaterials, cells, and biomolecules in a predefined architecture. This review highlights the recent developments in 3D cancer modeling using different bioprinting techniques to recreate the TME. 3D bioprinters enable the fabrication of high-resolution microstructures to reproduce TME intricacies. Furthermore, 3D bioprinted models can be applied as a preclinical model for versatile research applications in the tumor biology and pharmaceutical industries. These models provide an opportunity to develop high-throughput drug screening platforms and can further be developed to suit individual patient requirements hence giving a boost to the field of personalized anti-cancer therapeutics. We underlined the various ways the existing studies have tried to mimic the TME, mimic the hallmark events of cancer growth and metastasis within the 3D bioprinted models and showcase the 3D drug-tumor interaction and further utilization of such models to develop personalized medicine.",

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) is an inherited disease characterized by progressive breakdown of heart muscle, myocardial tissue death, and fibrofatty replacement. In most cases of AC, the primary lesion occurs in one of the genes encoding desmosomal proteins, disruption of which increases membrane fragility at the intercalated disc. Disrupted, exposed desmosomal proteins also serve as epitopes that can trigger an autoimmune reaction. Damage to cell membranes and autoimmunity provoke myocardial inflammation, a key feature in early stages of the disease. In several preclinical models, targeting inflammation has been shown to blunt disease progression, but translation to the clinic has been sparse. Here we review current understanding of inflammatory pathways and how they interact with injured tissue and the immune system in AC. We further discuss the potential role of immunomodulatory therapies in AC.",

        "title": "Effects of Placenta-Derived Human Amniotic Epithelial Cells on the Wound Healing Process and TGF-\u03b2 Induced Scar Formation in Murine Ischemic-Reperfusion Injury Model",
        "abstract": "It is suggested that placenta-derived human amniotic epithelial cells, as important agents of regenerative medicine and stem cell therapy, can promote re-epithelialization and wound closure in an animal model of PU and reduce scar formation during wound healing. Pressure ulcers (PUs), a result of ischemic reperfusion (IR) injuries, are prevalent skin problems which show refractoriness against standard therapeutic approaches. Besides, scar formation is a critical complication of ulcers that affects functionality and the skin\u2019s cosmetic aspect. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of placenta-derived human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs), as important agents of regenerative medicine and stem cell therapy, on accelerating the healing of IR ulcers in mice. We also evaluated the effects of these cells on reducing the TGF\u03b2-induced scar formation. Male Balb/c mice at the age of 6\u20138 weeks were subjected to three IR cycles. Afterward, the mice were divided into three experimental groups (n\u2009=\u20096 per group), including the control group, vehicle group, and hAECs treatment group. Mice of the treatment group received 100 \u03bcL of fresh hAECs 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 cell/ml suspension in PBS. Afterward, mice were assessed by histological, stereological, molecular, and western blotting techniques at 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after wounding. The histological and stereological results showed the most diminutive scar formation and better healing in the hAECs treated group compared to control group. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the expression level of Col1A1 on days 3, 14, and 21 in the hAECs treated group was significantly lower than control. Additionally, injection of hAECs significantly reduced the expression level of Col3A1 on days 3, 7, and 21 while increased Col3A1 on the day 14. Otherwise, in the hAECs treated group, the expression levels of VEGFA on days 7 and 14 were higher, which showed that hAECs could promote angiogenesis and wound healing. Also, cell therapy significantly lowered the protein levels of TGF-\u03b21 on day 14, while the protein level of TGF-\u03b23 on day 14 was significantly higher. This data could demonstrate the role of hAECs in scar reduction in IR wounds. These results suggest that hAECs can promote re-epithelialization and wound closure in an animal model of PU. They also reduced scar formation during wound healing by reducing the expression of TGF-\u03b21/ TGF-\u03b23 ratio.",

        "abstract": "This study set up a robust in vitro immune assay and conducted integrated transcriptome and secretome analyses to dissect molecular pathways driving UC-MSC-mediated immune modulation and proposed that identified immunomodulatory molecules and pathways could potentially be translated into clinical settings in order to improve UC- MSC-therapy quality and efficacy. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been used in over 800 clinical trials with encouraging results in the field of transplant medicine and chronic inflammatory diseases. Today, Umbilical Cord (UC)-derived MSC are the second leading source used for clinical purposes, mainly due to its easy access and superior immune modulatory effects. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms of immune suppressive activities have not been fully understood, research over the last decade strongly suggests that MSC-mediated benefits are closely related to activation of secretome networks. Nevertheless, recent findings also point to cytokine-independent mechanisms as key players of MSC-mediated immune modulation. Here, we set up a robust in vitro immune assay using phytohemagglutinin- or anti-CD3/CD28-treated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in cell-to-cell interaction or in cell-contact independent format with UC-MSC and conducted integrated transcriptome and secretome analyses to dissect molecular pathways driving UC-MSC-mediated immune modulation. Under inflammatory stimuli, multiparametric analyses of the secretome led us to identify cytokine/chemokine expression patterns associated with the induction of MSC-reprogrammed macrophages and T cell subsets ultimately leading to immune suppression. UC-MSC transcriptome analysis under inflammatory challenge allowed the identification of 47 differentially expressed genes, including chemokines, anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules found also in UC-MSC-immunosupressive secretomes, including the novel candidate soluble IL-2R. This study enabled us to track functionally activated UC-MSC during immune suppression and opened an opportunity to explore new pathways involved in immunity control by UC-MSC. We propose that identified immunomodulatory molecules and pathways could potentially be translated into clinical settings in order to improve UC-MSC-therapy quality and efficacy.",

        "abstract": "There is an unmet medical need for the early treatment of small melanocytic lesions or small melanomas in the eye to achieve local disease control and vision preservation with the possibility to prevent metastases and improve overall patient survival. Although it is a relatively rare disease, primarily found in the Caucasian population, uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular tumor in adults with a mean age-adjusted incidence of 5.1 cases per million per year. Tumors are located either in iris (4%), ciliary body (6%), or choroid (90%). The host susceptibility factors for uveal melanoma include fair skin, light eye color, inability to tan, ocular or oculodermal melanocytosis, cutaneous or iris or choroidal nevus, and BRCA1-associated protein 1 mutation. Currently, the most widely used first-line treatment options for this malignancy are resection, radiation therapy, and enucleation. There are two main types of radiation therapy: plaque brachytherapy (iodine-125, ruthenium-106, or palladium-103, or cobalt-60) and teletherapy (proton beam, helium ion, or stereotactic radiosurgery using cyber knife, gamma knife, or linear accelerator). The alternative to radiation is enucleation. Although these therapies achieve satisfactory local disease control, long-term survival rate for patients with uveal melanoma remains guarded, with risk for liver metastasis. There have been advances in early diagnosis over the past few years, and with the hope survival rates could improve as smaller tumors are treated. As in many other cancer indications, both early detection and early treatment could be critical for a positive long-term survival outcome in uveal melanoma. These observations call attention to an unmet medical need for the early treatment of small melanocytic lesions or small melanomas in the eye to achieve local disease control and vision preservation with the possibility to prevent metastases and improve overall patient survival.",

        "abstract": "This review summarizes the present state of the art in the derivation and maintenance of pluripotent stem cells in domestic animals. Abstract Pluripotent cells are unique because of their ability to differentiate into the cell lineages forming the entire organism. True pluripotent stem cells with germ line contribution have been reported for mice and rats. Human pluripotent cells share numerous features of pluripotentiality, but confirmation of their in vivo capacity for germ line contribution is impossible due to ethical and legal restrictions. Progress toward derivation of embryonic stem cells from domestic species has been made, but the derived cells were not able to produce germ line chimeras and thus are termed embryonic stem-like cells. However, domestic animals, in particular the domestic pig (Sus scrofa), are excellent large animals models, in which the clinical potential of stem cell therapies can be studied. Reprogramming technologies for somatic cells, including somatic cell nuclear transfer, cell fusion, in vitro culture in the presence of cell extracts, in vitro conversion of adult unipotent spermatogonial stem cells into germ line derived pluripotent stem cells, and transduction with reprogramming factors have been developed with the goal of obtaining pluripotent, germ line competent stem cells from domestic animals. This review summarizes the present state of the art in the derivation and maintenance of pluripotent stem cells in domestic animals.",

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), as the most common cell source for stem cell therapy, play an important role in the modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses and have been widely used in clinical trials to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Recent experimental and clinical studies have shown that MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) can inhibit the activation and proliferation of a variety of proinflammatory cells, such as Th1, Th17 and M1 macrophages, reducing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, while promoting the proliferation of anti-inflammatory cells, such as M2 macrophages and Tregs, and increasing the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, thus playing a role in immune regulation and exhibiting immunomodulatory functions. Besides MSC-EVs are more convenient and less immunogenic than MSCs. There is growing interest in the role of MSC-EVs in liver diseases owing to the intrinsic liver tropism of MSC-EVs. In this review, we focus on the immunomodulatory effects of MSC-EVs and summarize the pivotal roles of MSC-EVs as a cell-free therapy in liver diseases, including NAFLD, AIH, acute liver failure, liver fibrosis and hepatic ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury. Moreover, we provide a concise overview of the potential use and limits of MSC-EVs in clinical application.",

        "abstract": "A review on potential techniques to incorporate peptides in current surface coating strategies that will serve as a guide for developing cost-effective, sustainable and coherent antiviral surface coatings is presented. The transmission of pathogens through contact with contaminated surfaces is an important route for the spread of infections. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 highlights the necessity to attenuate surface-mediated transmission. Currently, the disinfection and sanitization of surfaces are commonly performed in this regard. However, there are some disadvantages associated with these practices, including the development of antibiotic resistance, viral mutation, etc.; hence, a better strategy is necessary. In recent years, peptides have been studied to be utilized as a potential alternative. They are part of the host immune defense and have many potential in vivo applications in drug delivery, diagnostics, immunomodulation, etc. Additionally, the ability of peptides to interact with different molecules and membrane surfaces of microorganisms has made it possible to exploit them in ex vivo applications such as antimicrobial (antibacterial and antiviral) coatings. Although antibacterial peptide coatings have been studied extensively and proven to be effective, antiviral coatings are a more recent development. Therefore, this study aims to highlight antiviral coating strategies and the current practices and application of antiviral coating materials in personal protective equipment, healthcare devices, and textiles and surfaces in public settings. Here, we have presented a review on potential techniques to incorporate peptides in current surface coating strategies that will serve as a guide for developing cost-effective, sustainable and coherent antiviral surface coatings. We further our discussion to highlight some challenges of using peptides as a surface coating material and to examine future perspectives.",

        "abstract": "The current status of the two most robust in vitro approaches in improving hepatocyte phenotype and metabolism while mimicking the hepatic physiological microenvironment are reviewed: organoids and liver-on-chip. The liver is the most important metabolic hub of endo and xenobiotic compounds. Pre-clinical studies using rodents to evaluate the toxicity of new drugs and cosmetics may produce inconclusive results for predicting clinical outcomes in humans, moreover being banned in the European Union. Human liver modeling using primary hepatocytes presents low reproducibility due to batch-to-batch variability, while iPSC-derived hepatocytes in monolayer cultures (2D) show reduced cellular functionality. Here we review the current status of the two most robust in vitro approaches in improving hepatocyte phenotype and metabolism while mimicking the hepatic physiological microenvironment: organoids and liver-on-chip. Both technologies are reviewed in design and manufacturing techniques, following cellular composition and functionality. Furthermore, drug screening and liver diseases modeling efficiencies are summarized. Finally, organoid and liver-on-chip technologies are compared regarding advantages and limitations, aiming to guide the selection of appropriate models for translational research and the development of such technologies.",

        "abstract": "Interestingly, a single exposure to PHB MPs led to decreased activity levels of CAT and GST in gills, SOD in digestive glands and SeGPx in both tissues, suggesting an apparent absence of combined effects of microplastics with the pollutant. ABSTRACT A growing interest in developing and commercialization of new eco-friendly plastic polymers is occurring attributed to the impact of marine plastics debris and microplastics that result from the degradation of oil-based polymers as these substances adversely affect ecosystem health. Recently, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) has become of interest due to its biodegradability and physicochemical properties. However, biological consequences resulting from bioplastics exposure remain to be determined. Further, few data are apparently available regarding the potential for bioplastics to act as a vector for exogenous chemicals in the environment. The aim of the study was to compare the effects of polyethylene (PE MPs) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB MPs) microplastics administered alone or in combination with fluoranthene (Flu) on detoxifying enzymes in digestive glands and gills of Mytilus edulis. Blue mussels were exposed for 96h to eight experimental groups: control, Flu-only, PE MPs-only, PHB MPs-only, PE MPs-Flu co-exposure, PHB MPs-Flu co-exposure, Flu-incubated PE MPs, and Flu-incubated PHB MPs. Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidases (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glutathione reductase (GR) were found to be significantly susceptible to Flu and plastics in both tissues. Interestingly, a single exposure to PHB MPs led to decreased activity levels of CAT and GST in gills, SOD in digestive glands and SeGPx in both tissues. In co-exposure and incubation treatments, biochemical responses were generally comparable with those exerted by PE MPs or PHB MPs only, suggesting an apparent absence of combined effects of microplastics with the pollutant. Data demonstrated the ecotoxicological impact of bioplastics materials on digestive glands and gills of Mytilus edulis.",

        "abstract": "Three anti-inflammatory microglial systems relevant for neuropsychiatry are examined: lactate, oxytocin, and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. A paradigm shift is currently taking place in the etiopathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders as immunometabolism is replacing the earlier neurotransmitter model. According to the new concept, cellular bioenergetics drives information processing in the central nervous system; therefore, neuropathology is conceptualized as a direct consequence of impaired metabolism. Along the same lines, endoplasmic reticulum stress and gut barrier dysfunction are emerging as novel targets in schizophrenia and affective disorders, linking immune responses to cellular distress. Furthermore, microglia, the brain\u2019s innate immune cells, acquire energy through oxidative phosphorylation, while in the resting state, and glycolysis upon activation, contributing to lactate accumulation and reduced brain pH. The same metabolic signature characterizes neuropsychiatric disorders as the central nervous system derives adenosine triphosphate from aerobic glycolysis, upregulating lactate and generating an acidic environment. Although known for over three decades, the link between dysmetabolism and neuropathology was poorly defined until the discovery of brain-resident innate lymphoid cells, including natural killer cells, and lactylation of histone and nonhistone proteins. In this perspective article, we examine three anti-inflammatory microglial systems relevant for neuropsychiatry: lactate, oxytocin, and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. We also discuss potential interventions for restoring microglial homeostasis.",

Human embryonic stem (hES) cells, unlike most cells derived from adult or fetal human tissues, represent a potentially unlimited source of various cell types for basic clinical research. To meet the increased demand for characterized hES cell lines, we established and characterized nine new lines obtained from frozen-thawed pronucleus-stage embryos. In addition, we improved the derivation efficiency from inner cell masses (to 47.4%) and optimized culture conditions for undifferentiated hES cells. After these cell lines had been maintained for over a year in vitro, they were characterized comprehensively for expression of markers of undifferentiated hES cells, karyotype, and in vitro/in vivo differentiation capacity. All of the cell lines were pluripotent, and one cell line was trisomic for chromosome 3. Improved culture techniques for hES cells should make them a good source for diverse applications in regenerative medicine, but further investigation is needed of their basic biology.",

AIM\nTo explore the alteration of DNA methyltransferase expression in gastric cancer and to assess its prognostic value.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom April 2000 to December 2010, 227 men and 73 women with gastric cancer were enrolled in the study. The expression of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), including DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b, in the 300 cases of gastric carcinoma, of which 85 had paired adjacent normal gastric mucus samples, was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray. Serum anti-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) IgG was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The relationships between the above results and the clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed. Their prognostic value was evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards model.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn gastric cancer, expression of DNMTs was mainly seen in the nucleus. Weak staining was also observed in the cytoplasm. Expression of DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b in gastric cancer was significantly higher compared to that in the paired control samples (60.0% vs 37.6%, 61.2% vs 4.7%, and 94.1% vs 71.8%, P < 0.01). The overall survival rate was significantly higher in the DNMT3a negative group than in the DNMT3a positive group in gastric cancer patients (Log-rank test, P = 0.032). No significant correlation was observed between DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression and the overall survival time (Log-rank test, P = 0.289, P = 0.347). Multivariate regression analysis indicated that DNMT3a expression (P = 0.025) and TNM stage (P < 0.001), but not DNMT1 (P = 0.54) or DNMT3b (P = 0.62), were independent prognostic factors in gastric cancer. H. pylori infection did not induce protein expression of DNMTs.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe results suggest that expression of DNMT3a is an independent poor prognostic indicator in gastric cancer. DNMT3a might play an important role in gastric carcinogenesis.",

        "abstract": "A positive relationship between serum uric acid and lumbar BMD among most old adults was revealed and this association followed an inverted U-shaped curve among blacks. Objectives Uric acid has been found to be potentially protective in bone metabolism. We investigated the relationship between serum uric acid (sUA) and lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) among 4156 participants aged 60 years and over from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods To estimate the association between sUA and lumbar BMD, multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted. Fitted smoothing curves and generalized additive models were also performed. Results We found sUA positively correlated with lumbar BMD after adjusting for other confounders. On subgroup analyses, stratified by sex and race/ethnicity, the positive correlation of sUA with lumbar BMD remained in both men and women, as well as in whites and Mexican Americans, but not in blacks. In blacks, the association of sUA with lumbar BMD was an inverted U-shaped curve (inflection point: 7.5\u2009mg/dL). Conclusions Our study revealed a positive relationship between sUA and lumbar BMD among most old adults. This association followed an inverted U-shaped curve among blacks.",

        "abstract": "Measuring serum progesterone levels on the day of ET and incrementing P supplementation if serum levels of progestersone are less than 15\u2009ng/mL to obtain optimal progester one levels during the WOI in both fresh and frozen ET cycles might help in improving pregnancy outcomes. Context: Luteal phase defect has been identified in all assisted reproductive technology cycles, necessitating optimal progesterone levels during the window of implantation (WOI) to improve reproductive outcomes. Aims: The aim of this study was to determine if incrementing progesterone supplementation based on the levels of serum progesterone(P) measured on the day of embryo transfer (ET) has an impact on the pregnancy outcome in fresh and frozen ET cycles. Settings and Design: A total of 220 women undergoing fresh and frozen ET were prospectively enrolled and received standard luteal phase support, an increment in P supplementation made if serum P levels were less than 15\u2009ng/mL. Materials and Methods: Serum progesterone levels were assessed for all the patients on the day of ET. Patients undergoing fresh and frozen ETs were divided into two groups based on serum progesterone levels on the day of ET. If serum progesterone levels were found to be less than 15\u2009ng/mL on the day of ET, the dose of progesterone supplementation was incremented. A correlation between the groups with serum progesterone less than and more than 15\u2009ng/mL on the day of ET with the pregnancy outcome was then made. Results: No statistically significant difference was observed in the clinical pregnancy rate and biochemical pregnancies in the groups with serum progesterone levels less than or more than 15\u2009ng/mL on the day of ET when an increment in the progesterone supplementation was performed (both fresh, P = 0.35 and frozen cycles, P = 0.056). Statistical Analysis Used: Chi-square test was used for qualitative analysis, and the Student\u2019s t test was used for comparison of means. Conclusions: Measuring serum progesterone levels on the day of ET and incrementing P supplementation if serum levels of progesterone are less than 15\u2009ng/mL to obtain optimal progesterone levels during the WOI in both fresh and frozen ET cycles might help in improving our pregnancy outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Tumour-derived exosomal LncSNHG16 modulates MMP9 via competitively binding to miR-942-3p in TCs, thus promoting the metastasis of HCC. Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell-derived exosomal LncRNA SNHG16 is highly expressed and associated with poor overall survival of patients. Telocytes (TCs), as novel interstitial cells, have been reported to promote HCC metastasis. Therefore, in our study, we investigated whether a molecular interaction occurred between exosomal LncSNHG16 and TCs in the tumor microenvironment. Methods LncSNHG16 expression in HCC tissues and cell lines was measured, and bioinformatics analysis was performed. Exosomes were isolated and purified from HCC cells with LncSNHG16 overexpression/knockdown vectors and cocultured with TCs. Then, markers of the LncSNHG16/miR-942-3p/MMP9 axis were tested in TCs. Transwell assays and cell wound healing assays were designed to examine the invasion and migration of HCC cells after coincubation with TCs. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays and dual-luciferase gene reporter assays were performed to verify the binding effect of LncSNHG16, miR-942-3p, and MMP9 mRNA. In vivo , experimental animal models were established to confirm the effect of exosomal LncSNHG16-induced MMP9 expression on HCC metastasis. Results Exosomal LncSNHG16 was phagocytized by TCs and downregulated miR-942-3p, which induced targeted MMP9 upregulation, and it had specific binding sites with miR-942-3p in TCs to facilitate the migration of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo . Exosomal LncSNHG16 was found to act as a competing endogenous RNA of the miR-942-3p/MMP9 axis in TCs. Conclusion Tumour-derived exosomal LncSNHG16 modulates MMP9 via competitively binding to miR-942-3p in TCs, thus promoting the metastasis of HCC.",

        "abstract": "An overview of the proposed players and triggers involved in inflammation in ACM is provided, focusing on those studied using in vivo and in vitro models. Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is a rare inherited cardiac disease characterized by arrhythmia and progressive fibro-fatty replacement of the myocardium, which leads to heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Inflammation contributes to disease progression, and it is characterized by inflammatory cell infiltrates in the damaged myocardium and inflammatory mediators in the blood of ACM patients. However, the molecular basis of inflammatory process in ACM remains under investigated and it is unclear whether inflammation is a primary event leading to arrhythmia and myocardial damage or it is a secondary response triggered by cardiomyocyte death. Here, we provide an overview of the proposed players and triggers involved in inflammation in ACM, focusing on those studied using in vivo and in vitro models. Deepening current knowledge of inflammation-related mechanisms in ACM could help identifying novel therapeutic perspectives, such as anti-inflammatory therapy.",

        "abstract": "HAECT through subcutaneous injection appears to significantly improve the wound-healing rate of stage III PUs in rats, and this effect may be associated with the upregulation of the proangiogenic factor VEGF and the down regulation of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1. The aim of the present study was to determine the function of human amniotic epithelial cell transplantation (hAECT) in promoting the healing of rats with stage III pressure ulcer (PU) and to initially investigate its possible mechanisms. A total of 96 Sprague Dawley rats were allocated at random into the model, hAECT, conventional treatment or control groups (n=24 per group). In each group, 6 rats were observed to determine the wound-healing rate. The mRNA and protein expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in the wound tissue and serum were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The transplantation of hAECs significantly increased the healing rate of the stage III PUs and was accompanied by the significant upregulation of VEGF mRNA and protein expression levels and the significant downregulation of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA and protein expression. Immunofluorescence staining showed that, on day 7 of transplantation, hAECs remained alive inside the skin tissues. Therefore, hAECT through subcutaneous injection appears to significantly improve the wound-healing rate of stage III PUs in rats, and this effect may be associated with the upregulation of the proangiogenic factor VEGF and the downregulation of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1.",
