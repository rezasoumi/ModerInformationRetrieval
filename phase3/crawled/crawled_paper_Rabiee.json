        "abstract": "A structured dictionary-based model for hyperspectral data that incorporates both spectral and contextual characteristics of spectral samples and is capable of finding representations that may effectively be used for classification of multispectral resolution samples is presented. This paper presents a structured dictionary-based model for hyperspectral data that incorporates both spectral and contextual characteristics of spectral samples. The idea is to partition the pixels of a hyperspectral image into a number of spatial neighborhoods called contextual groups and to model the pixels inside a group as members of a common subspace. That is, each pixel is represented using a linear combination of a few dictionary elements learned from the data, but since pixels inside a contextual group are often made up of the same materials, their linear combinations are constrained to use common elements from the dictionary. To this end, dictionary learning is carried out with a joint sparse regularizer to induce a common sparsity pattern in the sparse coefficients of a contextual group. The sparse coefficients are then used for classification using a linear support vector machine. Experimental results on a number of real hyperspectral images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed representation for hyperspectral image classification. Moreover, experiments with simulated multispectral data show that the proposed model is capable of finding representations that may effectively be used for classification of multispectral resolution samples.",

        "abstract": "This article presents a hybrid approach for breaking down large, complex deep neural networks for cooperative, and privacy-preserving analytics, and shows that by using Siamese fine-tuning and at a small processing cost, this approach can greatly reduce the level of unnecessary, potentially sensitive information in the personal data. Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and applications are being deployed in our homes and workplaces. These devices often rely on continuous data collection to feed machine learning models. However, this approach introduces several privacy and efficiency challenges, as the service operator can perform unwanted inferences on the available data. Recently, advances in edge processing have paved the way for more efficient, and private, data processing at the source for simple tasks and lighter models, though they remain a challenge for larger and more complicated models. In this article, we present a hybrid approach for breaking down large, complex deep neural networks for cooperative, and privacy-preserving analytics. To this end, instead of performing the whole operation on the cloud, we let an IoT device to run the initial layers of the neural network, and then send the output to the cloud to feed the remaining layers and produce the final result. In order to ensure that the user\u2019s device contains no extra information except what is necessary for the main task and preventing any secondary inference on the data, we introduce Siamese fine-tuning. We evaluate the privacy benefits of this approach based on the information exposed to the cloud service. We also assess the local inference cost of different layers on a modern handset. Our evaluations show that by using Siamese fine-tuning and at a small processing cost, we can greatly reduce the level of unnecessary, potentially sensitive information in the personal data, thus achieving the desired tradeoff between utility, privacy, and performance.",

We present and evaluate Deep Private-Feature Extractor (DPFE), a deep model which is trained and evaluated based on information theoretic constraints. Using the selective exchange of information between a user's device and a service provider, DPFE enables the user to prevent certain sensitive information from being shared with a service provider, while allowing them to extract approved information using their model. We introduce and utilize the log-rank privacy, a novel measure to assess the effectiveness of DPFE in removing sensitive information and compare different models based on their accuracy-privacy trade-off. We then implement and evaluate the performance of DPFE on smartphones to understand its complexity, resource demands, and efficiency trade-offs. Our results on benchmark image datasets demonstrate that under moderate resource utilization, DPFE can achieve high accuracy for primary tasks while preserving the privacy of sensitive information.",

        "abstract": "The idea is to divide the hyperspectral image into a number of super-pixels by means of the super-pixel segmentation method, and each super- pixel is a spatial neighborhood called contextual group that has a common sparse pattern by using the joint sparse regularizer for dictionary learning. This paper presents a superpixel-level dictionary learning model for hyperspectral data. The idea is to divide the hyperspectral image into a number of super-pixels by means of the super-pixel segmentation method. Each super-pixel is a spatial neighborhood called contextual group. That is, each pixel is represented using a linear combination of a few dictionary items learned from the train data, but since pixels inside a super-pixel are often consisting of the same materials, their linear combinations are constrained to use common items from the dictionary. To this end, the sparse coefficients of the context group have a common sparse pattern by using the joint sparse regularizer for dictionary learning. The sparse coefficients are then used for classification using linear support vector machines. The validity of the proposed method is experimentally verified on a real hyperspectral images.",

        "abstract": "The spectral and spatial redundancies of hyperspectral images are used for designing a sparse representation-based classification approach and a sparse coding algorithm is proposed that alleviates the instability of the sparse coefficients. In this study, the spectral and spatial redundancies of hyperspectral images are used for designing a sparse representation-based classification approach. The spectral redundancy is used to define spectral blocks and they are used to adaptively recognize the distinctive bands. The most distinctive blocks are identified as active blocks in a block sparse representation approach. Then the sparse coefficients within each spatial group are imposed to share a common subspace. To achieve this hierarchical sparsity pattern a sparse coding algorithm is proposed. This sparse coding is done over a block-structured dictionary, which is learned from the image data using the online dictionary learning algorithm. The obtained sparse coefficients are then classified using a support vector machine classifier. This structured sparsity pattern alleviates the instability of the sparse coefficients. Experiments on two standard datasets namely, Indian Pines and Pavia University, verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the classification of hyperspectral images.",

This paper presents a sparse-representation-based classification approach with a novel dictionary construction procedure. By using the constructed dictionary, sophisticated prior knowledge about the spatial nature of the image can be integrated. The approach is based on the assumption that each image patch can be factorized into characteristic spatial patterns, also called shapelets, and patch-specific spectral information. A set of shapelets is learned in an unsupervised way, and spectral information is embodied by training samples. A combination of shapelets and spectral information is represented in an undercomplete spatial-spectral dictionary for each individual patch, where the elements of the dictionary are linearly combined to a sparse representation of the patch. The patch-based classification is obtained by means of the representation error. Experiments are conducted on three well-known hyperspectral image data sets. They illustrate that our proposed approach shows superior results in comparison to sparse-representation-based classifiers that use only limited spatial information and behaves competitively with or better than state-of-the-art classifiers utilizing spatial information and kernelized sparse-representation-based classifiers.",

        "abstract": "A novel spectral-spatial online dictionary learning (SSODL) method for HSI classification is proposed, which aims to learn a complete and discriminative dictionary by exploiting both spatial and spectral information all over the whole image. Sparse representation (SR) based hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is a rapidly evolving research topic. How to construct an optimized dictionary to better characterize spectral-spatial features of HSI is an important problem. In this paper, a novel spectral-spatial online dictionary learning (SSODL) method for HSI classification is proposed. The main idea is to learn a complete and discriminative dictionary by exploiting both spatial and spectral information all over the whole image. Rather than only using training samples for dictionary construction, the online dictionary learning (ODL) mechanism can effectively improve the adaptive representation capability of different pixels. Specifically, the contextual characteristics of HSI are integrated with discriminative spectral information for the ODL, i.e., pushing similar pixels in neighborhood to share similar sparse coefficients w.r.t. the well learnt dictionary. By this way, the yielding sparse coefficients are structured and discriminative. Finally, a traditional classifier, i.e., linear support vector mechine (SVM), is applied to the sparse coefficients and the final classification results are obtained. Experimental results on real HSIs show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "A contextual online dictionary learning (DL) method for HSIs classification is proposed, which learns a dictionary over the whole image rather than few labeled pixels, and can effectively and efficiently improve the adaptive representation capability of different pixels with an online learning mechanism. Sparse representation (SR) has been successfully used in the classification of hyperspectral images (HSIs) by representing HSI pixels over a dictionary and yielding discriminative sparse coefficients. Most of SR-based classification methods construct the dictionary by directly using some labeled pixels as atoms. Such dictionary can lead to inefficient SR for large-sized HSIs, and may be incomplete when the number of labeled pixels is less than the number of spectral bands. This paper proposes a contextual online dictionary learning (DL) method for HSIs classification, which learns a dictionary over the whole image rather than few labeled pixels. The proposed method can effectively and efficiently improve the adaptive representation capability of different pixels with an online learning mechanism. Specifically, the contextual characteristics of the HSI are integrated with discriminative spectral information for online DL, i.e., pushing similar pixels in neighborhood to share similar sparse coefficients with respect to the well-learned dictionary.

        "abstract": "A new algorithm of HSI classification based on discriminative eigenpixels-based dictionary learning is proposed, which code a homogeneous region associated with a query pixel on the learned dictionary to determine its label by use of both the nearest neighbor (NN) classifier and majority voting. Sparse representation (SR) model has been applied to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification based on the observation that any spectral pixel could be approximately represented by a linear combination of several common pixels, but its discriminative ability is not deeply explored due to an insufficient description on spatial\u2013spectral information and less emphasis on the dictionary structure. In this letter, we propose a new algorithm of HSI classification based on discriminative eigenpixels-based dictionary learning. Instead of using neighbor pixels directly, we define a new homogeneous region for each pixel, respectively, to exploit more spatial\u2013spectral information and extract eigenpixels from homogeneous regions to preserve the essentials for each class. For the representation-based model, a discriminative eigenpixels-based dictionary is learned in homogeneous regions, where the locality of pixels is exploited to enhance the discriminative ability. Finally, we code a homogeneous region associated with a query pixel on the learned dictionary to determine its label by use of both the nearest neighbor (NN) classifier and majority voting. Experiments are conducted on four HSIs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "A new local differentially private (LDP) algorithm named LATENT is proposed that redesigns the training process and enables a data owner to add a randomization layer before data leave the data owners\u2019 devices and reach a potentially untrusted machine learning service. The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming major industries, including but not limited to healthcare, agriculture, finance, energy, and transportation. IoT platforms are continually improving with innovations, such as the amalgamation of software-defined networks (SDNs) and network function virtualization (NFV) in the edge-cloud interplay. Deep learning (DL) is becoming popular due to its remarkable accuracy when trained with a massive amount of data such as generated by IoT. However, DL algorithms tend to leak privacy when trained on highly sensitive crowd-sourced data such as medical data. The existing privacy-preserving DL algorithms rely on the traditional server-centric approaches requiring high processing powers. We propose a new local differentially private (LDP) algorithm named LATENT that redesigns the training process. LATENT enables a data owner to add a randomization layer before data leave the data owners\u2019 devices and reach a potentially untrusted machine learning service. This feature is achieved by splitting the architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN) into three layers: 1) convolutional module (CNM); 2) randomization module; and 3) fully connected module. Hence, the randomization module can operate as an NFV privacy preservation service in an SDN-controlled NFV, making LATENT more practical for IoT-driven cloud-based environments compared to existing approaches. The randomization module employs a newly proposed LDP protocol named utility enhancing randomization, which allows LATENT to maintain high utility compared to existing LDP protocols. Our experimental evaluation of LATENT on convolutional deep neural networks demonstrates excellent accuracy (e.g., 91%\u201396%) with high model quality even under low privacy budgets (e.g., $\\varepsilon =0.5$ ).",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a FOg-based pRivacy prEServing dEep lEarNing framework named FORESEEN, capable of reducing the communication cost and providing inherent support for robustness and scalability, and builds deep models with mixed-precision. In state-of-the-art deep learning, centralized deep learning forces end devices to pool their data in the cloud in order to train a global model on the joint data, while distributed deep learning requires a parameter server to mediate the training process among multiple end devices. However, none of these architectures scale gracefully to large-scale privacy and time-sensitive IoT applications. Therefore, we are motivated to propose a FOg-based pRivacy prEServing dEep lEarNing framework named FORESEEN, so as to achieve scalable, accurate yet private analytics. In FORESEEN, the intermediate fog nodes and the cloud collaboratively perform noisy training of deep neural networks (DNNs), while each end device and its connected fog node collaboratively perform fast, private yet accurate inference. To enhance robustness and ensure privacy, we put forward a collaborative noisy training algorithm and develop a novel representation perturber to perturb the extracted features by combining random projection, random noise addition and data nullification. To meet the required constraints of accuracy, memory and energy in IoT end devices, we build deep models with mixed-precision. Through these sophisticated designs, FORESEEN is able to not only preserve privacy but also maintain comparable inference performance. Extensive experimental results under different datasets, different inference schemes and different noise addition strategies validate the effectiveness of FORESEEN. Moreover, FORESEEN is capable of reducing the communication cost and providing inherent support for robustness and scalability.",

With the increase in the usage of IoT and mobile devices in our day to day lives results in generating vast amount of data, as well as increase in advanced services and applications such as VR, augmented reality and a race for building smart cities made it a challenging situation for cloud computing in terms of latency, privacy and scalability to resolve all these challenges edge computing falls into play as a modern model of computing where computing and storage are located closer to the data center, allowing a new latency and bandwidth-sensitive application class where data is processed at the nearer edge without sending it to the cloud [9]. The goal of this study is to implement an effective and safe proactive strategy (instead of sending a response of a query to each node, node should have its own local computational resources that updates the parameter to the central server) on edge devices which will provide more privacy, as personal data are processed at the nearest edge that can be leaked or exploited by any intruder and because of latency problem in the centralized approach there is a need for effective decentralized system, which additionally should give better outcome as off-base outcome can at some point be calamitous, like in the case of auto-driving car. We will also be presenting how we can utilize numerous encryption technique to scramble data for model training which regardless of whether get hacked by an intruder would be of no use, as if confidential data learned by the model or leaked to an intruder might lead to a significant loss. The proposed method would be tested to all the machine learning problems like word suggestion, image classification and many more.",

        "abstract": "A noisy training method is proposed to enhance the cloud-side network robustness to perturbed data and can not only preserve privacy but also improve the inference performance. The increasing demand for on-device deep learning services calls for a highly efficient manner to deploy deep neural networks (DNNs) on mobile devices with limited capacity. The cloud-based solution is a promising approach to enabling deep learning applications on mobile devices where the large portions of a DNN are offloaded to the cloud. However, revealing data to the cloud leads to potential privacy risk. To benefit from the cloud data center without the privacy risk, we design, evaluate, and implement a cloud-based framework ARDEN which partitions the DNN across mobile devices and cloud data centers. A simple data transformation is performed on the mobile device, while the resource-hungry training and the complex inference rely on the cloud data center. To protect the sensitive information, a lightweight privacy-preserving mechanism consisting of arbitrary data nullification and random noise addition is introduced, which provides strong privacy guarantee. A rigorous privacy budget analysis is given. Nonetheless, the private perturbation to the original data inevitably has a negative impact on the performance of further inference on the cloud side. To mitigate this influence, we propose a noisy training method to enhance the cloud-side network robustness to perturbed data. Through the sophisticated design, ARDEN can not only preserve privacy but also improve the inference performance. To validate the proposed ARDEN, a series of experiments based on three image datasets and a real mobile application are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ARDEN. Finally, we implement ARDEN on a demo system to verify its practicality.",

        "abstract": "This paper mediate between the resource-constrained edge devices and the privacy-invasive cloud servers by introducing a novel privacy-preserving edge-cloud inference framework, DataMix, which off-load the majority of the computations to the cloud and leverage a pair of mixing and de-mixing operation, inspired by mixup. Deep neural networks are widely deployed on edge devices (e.g ., for computer vision and speech recognition). Users either perform the inference locally (i.e., edge-based) or send the data to the cloud and run inference remotely (i.e., cloud-based). However, both solutions have their limitations: edge devices are heavily constrained by insufficient hardware resources and cannot afford to run large models; cloud servers, if not trustworthy, will raise serious privacy issues. In this paper, we mediate between the resource-constrained edge devices and the privacy-invasive cloud servers by introducing a novel privacy-preserving edge-cloud inference framework, DataMix. We off-load the majority of the computations to the cloud and leverage a pair of mixing and de-mixing operation, inspired by mixup, to protect the privacy of the data transmitted to the cloud. Our framework has three advantages. First, it is privacy-preserving as the mixing cannot be inverted without the user\u2019s private mixing coefficients. Second, our framework is accuracy-preserving because our framework takes advantage of the space spanned by images, and we train the model in a mixing-aware manner to maintain accuracy. Third, our solution is efficient on the edge since the majority of the workload is delegated to the cloud, and our mixing and de-mixing processes introduce very few extra computations. Also, our framework introduces small communication overhead and maintains high hardware utilization on the cloud. Extensive experiments on multiple computer vision and speech recognition datasets demonstrate that our framework can greatly reduce the local computations on the edge (to fewer than 20% of FLOPs) with negligible loss of accuracy and no leakages of private information.",

        "abstract": "A new local deferentially private algorithm is proposed that allows the Edge devices to apply random noise to features extracted from their sensitive data before transferred to an untrusted server. We address privacy and latency issues in the edge/cloud computing environment while training a centralized AI model. In our particular case, the edge devices are the only data source for the model to train on the central server. Current privacy-preserving and reducing network latency solutions rely on a pre-trained feature extractor deployed on the devices to help extract only important features from the sensitive dataset. However, finding a pre-trained model or pubic dataset to build a feature extractor for certain tasks may turn out to be very challenging. With the large amount of data generated by edge devices, the edge environment does not really lack data, but its improper access may lead to privacy concerns. In this paper, we present DeepGuess , a new privacy-preserving, and latency aware deeplearning framework. DeepGuess uses a new learning mechanism enabled by the AutoEncoder(AE) architecture called Inductive Learning, which makes it possible to train a central neural network using the data produced by end-devices while preserving their privacy. With inductive learning, sensitive data remains on devices and is not explicitly involved in any backpropagation process. The AE\u2019s Encoder is deployed on devices to extracts and transfers important features to the server. To enhance privacy, we propose a new local deferentially private algorithm that allows the Edge devices to apply random noise to features extracted from their sensitive data before transferred to an untrusted server. The experimental evaluation of DeepGuess demonstrates its effectiveness and ability to converge on a series of experiments.",

        "abstract": "A hybrid deep learning framework for privacy preservation in distributed DCs using Deep Neural Network for the feature extractor and classifier operations and Glow-worm Swarm Optimization algorithm is utilized to fine tune the hyperparameters of the DNN model to improve the overall efficiency. In recent times, a huge amount of data is being created from different sources and the size of the data generated on the Internet has already surpassed two Exabytes. Big Data processing and analysis can be employed in many disciplines which can aid the decision-making process with privacy preservation of users\u2019 private data. To store large quantity of data, Geo-Distributed Data Centres (GDDC) are developed. In recent times, several applications comprising data analytics and machine learning have been designed for GDDC. In this view, this paper presents a hybrid deep learning framework for privacy preservation in distributed DCs. The proposed model uses Deep Neural Network (DNN) for the feature extractor and classifier operations. In addition, Siamese training method is applied to fine-tune the prevention of secondary inference on the data. Moreover, gradient descent approach is employed to reduce the loss function of the DNN model. Furthermore, Glow-worm Swarm Optimization (GSO) algorithm is utilized to fine tune the hyperparameters of the DNN model to improve the overall efficiency. The proposed model is executed on a Hadoop based environment, i.e., Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), which has two nodes namely master node and slave nodes. The master node is considered as the main user node to get the services from the service provider. Every slave node behaves as per master node\u2019s instruction for data storage. In order to validate the enhanced performance of the proposed model, a series of simulations take place and the experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed model. The simple technique has reached a maximum gender recognition accuracy of 95, 90 and 79 on the applied data 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Also, the reduced simple approach has attained reduced gender recognition with the accuracy of 91, 84 and 74 on the applied data 1, 2 and 3 respectively.",

        "abstract": "This paper created a multitask crowd analysis dataset using two publicly available crowd behavior datasets (MED, GTA) and proposed a novel deep architecture for multitasking crowd analysis, which is compared with state-of-the-art and shown its effectiveness in multitaskingrowd analysis. Recently, crowd analysis has become an essential tool for crowd disaster management. The crowd analysis is not a single task but is a collective implication of several related tasks like crowd behavior analysis, crowd counting, and crowd flow analysis. Although different models for individual tasks have been proposed in the literature, there is a lack of a multitasking framework for crowd analysis. One of the main reasons could be the availability of the multitasking crowd analysis dataset. To this end, this paper created a multitask crowd analysis dataset using two publicly available crowd behavior datasets (MED, GTA) and proposed a novel deep architecture for multitasking crowd analysis. Two different crowd analysis tasks are considered, i.e., crowd behavior (normal and panic) and crowd counting. Around 89,000 frames were annotated for obtaining ground-truth crowd counts. In addition to this, a two-stage learning mechanism is proposed. In the first stage, a novel deep model is proposed that extracts high-level spatial-temporal features from the multiscale low-level spatial-temporal features and is used to learn normal crowd behavior and counting. The second stage utilized the features of the deep model and inputted them to the one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) for crowd panic detection. The obtained results are compared with state-of-the-art and show its effectiveness in multitasking crowd analysis.",

Camera sensors are increasingly being combined with machine learning to perform various tasks such as intelligent surveillance. Due to its computational complexity, most of these machine learning al-gorithms are o\ufb04oaded to the cloud for processing. However, users are increasingly concerned about privacy issues such as function creep and malicious usage by third-party cloud providers. To alleviate this, we propose an edge-based \ufb01ltering stage that removes privacy-sensitive attributes before the sensor data are transmitted to the cloud. We use state-of-the-art image manipulation techniques that leverage disentangled representations to achieve privacy \ufb01ltering. We de\ufb01ne opt-in and opt-out \ufb01lter operations and evaluate their e\ufb00ectiveness for \ufb01ltering pri-vate attributes from face images. Additionally, we examine the e\ufb00ect of naturally occurring correlations and residual information on \ufb01ltering.

        "abstract": "Experimental results show that the proposed sparsity-based algorithm for the classification of hyperspectral imagery outperforms the classical supervised classifier support vector machines in most cases. A new sparsity-based algorithm for the classification of hyperspectral imagery is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithm relies on the observation that a hyperspectral pixel can be sparsely represented by a linear combination of a few training samples from a structured dictionary. The sparse representation of an unknown pixel is expressed as a sparse vector whose nonzero entries correspond to the weights of the selected training samples. The sparse vector is recovered by solving a sparsity-constrained optimization problem, and it can directly determine the class label of the test sample. Two different approaches are proposed to incorporate the contextual information into the sparse recovery optimization problem in order to improve the classification performance. In the first approach, an explicit smoothing constraint is imposed on the problem formulation by forcing the vector Laplacian of the reconstructed image to become zero. In this approach, the reconstructed pixel of interest has similar spectral characteristics to its four nearest neighbors. The second approach is via a joint sparsity model where hyperspectral pixels in a small neighborhood around the test pixel are simultaneously represented by linear combinations of a few common training samples, which are weighted with a different set of coefficients for each pixel. The proposed sparsity-based algorithm is applied to several real hyperspectral images for classification. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the classical supervised classifier support vector machines in most cases.",

        "abstract": "A hyperspectral classification method with spatial filtering and \u21132,1 norm (SFL) that can deal with all the test pixels simultaneously and can obtain better classification performance than some other popular classifiers is proposed. Recently, the sparse representation based classification methods have received particular attention in the classification of hyperspectral imagery. However, current sparse representation based classification models have not considered all the test pixels simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a hyperspectral classification method with spatial filtering and \u21132,1 norm (SFL) that can deal with all the test pixels simultaneously. The \u21132,1 norm regularization is used to extract relevant training samples among the whole training data set with joint sparsity. In addition, the \u21132,1 norm loss function is adopted to make it robust for samples that deviate significantly from the rest of the samples. Moreover, to take the spatial information into consideration, a spatial filtering step is implemented where all the training and testing samples are spatially averaged with its nearest neighbors. Furthermore, the non-negative constraint is added to the sparse representation matrix motivated by hyperspectral unmixing. Finally, the alternating direction method of multipliers is used to solve SFL. Experiments on real hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed SFL method can obtain better classification performance than some other popular classifiers.",

        "abstract": "A novel method for one-class classification (OCC) using a kernel sparse representation model for remotely sensed imagery and results indicate that the proposed method outperforms these existing methods, particularly when using a Kernel sparse representation. Sparse representations have been widely studied in remote sensing image analysis in recent years. In this paper, we develop a novel method for one-class classification (OCC) using a kernel sparse representation model for remotely sensed imagery. Training samples taken from the target class alone are used to build a learning dictionary for the sparse representation model, which is then optimized to produce a reconstruction residual. In the proposed model, a pixel is classified as the target class if the obtained reconstruction residual for the pixel is smaller than a given threshold; otherwise, the pixel is labeled as the outlier class. To improve the data separability between the target and outliner classes, the training samples taken from the target class are mapped into a high-dimensional feature space using a kernel function to build a learning dictionary for the kernel sparse representation model. OCC is then conducted in the mapped high-dimensional feature space using the reconstruction residual threshold, following the same principle as OCC in the original feature space. The proposed OCC method is evaluated and compared with several existing OCC methods in three different case studies. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms these existing methods, particularly when using a kernel sparse representation.",

Sparse representation and dictionary learning have been successfully applied to encode dense data and facilitate image classification. Though existing dictionary learning methods achieve better performance than their counterparts, the class discriminative ability of learned dictionary is still limited. This paper proposes a novel supervised dictionary learning method based on the prior of the block diagonal phenomenon, i.e., each sample should be well reconstructed by the samples in the same class while poorly reconstructed by the samples in other class. Specifically, a block diagonal regularizer is imposed on the affinity matrix to enforce the sparse representation matrix to have an approximately block diagonal structure, which makes the learned dictionary more discriminative and suitable for classification tasks. Furthermore, we present an effective optimization strategy by combining the alternating minimization with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for the proposed framework. Experimental results on six real-world datasets show that the proposed method is more effective than state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods.",

        "abstract": "A novel context-aware CS (CACS) method for HSIs is proposed by incorporating contextual prior to the dictionary learning and the sparse reconstruction, which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over some state-of-the-art hyperspectral compressive imaging methods. Traditional hyperspectral imaging technique obtains numerous hyperspectral images (HSIs) with hundreds of spectral bands, leading to high cost in data acquisition, transmission, and storage. Compressed sensing (CS) theory provides a new imaging mechanism, which relies on the assumption that signals can be sparsely represented over a dictionary. By the CS imaging technique, original HSIs can be approximately reconstructed from only a few sampled measurements. In this article, a novel context-aware CS (CACS) method for HSIs is proposed by incorporating contextual prior to the dictionary learning and the sparse reconstruction. First, a patch-based online dictionary learning (ODL) algorithm is developed by introducing a joint sparse constraint. On the one hand, the online dictionary learning mechanism enables a more adaptive representation of HSIs with different scenes than using fixed-basis-based dictionaries, e.g., the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and the discrete wavelet transform dictionaries. On the other hand, the introduced joint sparse constraint promotes the learned dictionary to more sparsely and structurally represent spectral pixels. Then, with the well-learned dictionary, a weighted smoothing regularization is introduced to develop a new sparse reconstruction model. Considering the high spectral\u2013spatial similarity of pixels in a neighborhood, the new sparse reconstruction model will encourage a locally smoothing reconstruction result. In this way, the spectral\u2013spatial structures of the HSI can be well preserved, while possible artifacts can be effectively reduced. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over some state-of-the-art hyperspectral compressive imaging methods.",

This paper presents a new technique for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification by using superpixel guided deep-sparse-representation learning. The proposed technique constructs a hierarchical architecture by exploiting the sparse coding to learn the HSI representation. Specifically, a multiple-layer architecture using different superpixel maps is designed, where each superpixel map is generated by downsampling the superpixels gradually along with enlarged spatial regions for labeled samples. In each layer, sparse representation of pixels within every spatial region is computed to construct a histogram via the sum-pooling with  $l_{1}$  normalization. Finally, the representations (features) learned from the multiple-layer network are aggregated and trained by a support vector machine classifier. The proposed technique has been evaluated over three public HSI data sets, including the Indian Pines image set, the Salinas image set, and the University of Pavia image set. Experiments show superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "An efficient, three-layer hyperspectral image classification model by utilizing spectral/spatial features and a new proximity-based 2D edge preserving order-statistic filtering called Guided Median Filter (GMF) is introduced with weights assigned to each neighboring pixel. Hyperspectral images (HSI) contain rich spectral information from a large portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Using these images, it is possible to make pixel-level classification as each pixel holds hundreds of features. In this paper, we propose an efficient, three-layer hyperspectral image classification model by utilizing spectral/spatial features. The first layer of the system includes two classifiers that work in parallel. These classifiers generate probability scores that form the \"new feature set\" of the original dataset. The second layer is an ensemble classifier that combines the new features to generate the initial region classification. The third layer introduces a novel approach for enhancing the initial region classification's accuracy from the second layer by utilizing the spatial characteristics of the dataset. A new proximity-based 2D edge preserving order-statistic filtering called Guided Median Filter (GMF) is introduced with weights assigned to each neighboring pixel. Experimental results show that the proposed system improves our previously published results and reaches over 96% overall accuracy on Indian Pines dataset by exceeding some well-known traditional classifiers. Moreover, our GMF based system produced comparable results with the state-of-the-art neural network based methodologies without complex training stage and lack of interpretability of classification model.",

        "abstract": "A diagonalized low-rank learning (DLRL) model is proposed for HSI classification that combines sparsity and collaboration to extract more discriminative features for guaranteeing high information utilization and rich information in the HSI can be fully used for good feature extraction. Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is a current research hotspot. Most existing methods usually export discriminative features with low-quality distribution and low information utilization, which may induce classification performance degeneration. To remedy such deficiencies, we propose a diagonalized low-rank learning (DLRL) model for HSI classification in this study. Specifically, a classwise regularization is used to capture the classwise block-diagonal structure of low-rank representation, which can further cluster the represented HSI pixels from one class into the same subspace and extract features with well-ordered distribution. Such a regularization assists to easily and correctly classify HSIs. In addition, we combine sparsity and collaboration to extract more discriminative features for guaranteeing high information utilization, i.e., a tradeoff of sparsity and collaboration is sought to acquire both correlations among HSI pixels and characteristics of each pixel. By this way, rich information in the HSI can be fully used for good feature extraction. Further, the estimated feature representation is used as an input to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier for HSI classification. Extensive experiments have been done to validate that the proposed DLRL method achieves much classification performance in contrast to several state-of-the-art algorithms.",

        "abstract": "This paper designs a federated learning framework in a personalized fashion to reduce the accuracy loss caused by privacy-preserving techniques, and presents PFed-LDP, a private and accurate federated local differential privacy (LDP) framework for IoT sensing data. Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have shown great potential for smart Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the edge devices of IoT applications often collect and store only limited data, which is insufficient for training modern deep learning models. Collaborative training methods such as cloud computing and federated learning set steps to build robust models for IoT applications, yet these methods bring the concern of data privacy (e.g., untrusted central server, model inversion). On the other hand, directly applying privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy can dramatically degrade the performance of IoT applications. Inspired by the development of model personalization, we aim to design a federated learning framework in a personalized fashion to reduce the accuracy loss caused by privacy-preserving techniques. In this paper, we present PFed-LDP, a private and accurate federated local differential privacy (LDP) framework for IoT sensing data. We first design a dynamic layer sharing mechanism to separate the local model into global layers and personalized layers. Second, we apply LDP noise to the global layers and transmit them to the federated learning framework for aggregation. Third, each local client updates their model with local personalized layers and aggregated global layers to perform IoT tasks. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that we only sacrifice 1.6% of accuracy to achieve privacy-preserving IoT applications. We also observe that our method has the smallest accuracy range, which means we can achieve the best performance for the worst performed client.",

        "abstract": "This chapter is designed to provide extensive coverage in SL and its variants, including fundamentals, existing findings, integration with privacy measures such as differential privacy, open problems, and code implementation. In the distributed collaborative machine learning (DCML) paradigm, federated learning (FL) recently attracted much attention due to its applications in health, finance, and the latest innovations such as industry 4.0 and smart vehicles. FL provides privacy-by-design. It trains a machine learning model collaboratively over several distributed clients (ranging from two to millions) such as mobile phones, without sharing their raw data with any other participant. In practical scenarios, all clients do not have sufficient computing resources (e.g., Internet of Things), the machine learning model has millions of parameters, and its privacy between the server and the clients while training/testing is a prime concern (e.g., rival parties). In this regard, FL is not sufficient, so split learning (SL) is introduced. SL is reliable in these scenarios as it splits a model into multiple portions, distributes them among clients and server, and trains/tests their respective model portions to accomplish the full model training/testing. In SL, the participants do not share both data and their model portions to any other parties, and usually, a smaller network portion is assigned to the clients where data resides. Recently, a hybrid of FL and SL, called splitfed learning, is introduced to elevate the benefits of both FL (faster training/testing time) and SL (model split and training). Following the developments from FL to SL, and considering the importance of SL, this chapter is designed to provide extensive coverage in SL and its variants. The coverage includes fundamentals, existing findings, integration with privacy measures such as differential privacy, open problems, and code implementation.",

Big data analytics are pervasive in data-intensive systems and applications using machine learning and deep learning. IoT sensor devices are generating all types of big data, including structured (e.g., tables) and unstructured data (e.g., text and image), which are beyond the processing power of humans. However, how to conduct big data analysis on IoT data without compromising IoT privacy is still an open problem. IoT shall leverage powerful learning techniques to automatically learn patterns such as similarities, correlations and abnormalities from big sensing data in a privacy-preserving manner. To make this happen, we first examine distributed learning techniques that are suitable for IoT architectures. We then propose a privacy-preserving distributed learning framework with a novel dynamic deep learning mechanism to extract patterns and learn knowledge from IoT data.

        "abstract": "A comprehensive survey of the recent techniques and strategies developed to overcome resource challenges in pervasive AI systems, and an overview of pervasive computing, its architecture, and its intersection with artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed a substantial breakthrough in a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services, spanning from recommendation systems and speech processing applications to robotics control and military surveillance. This is driven by the easier access to sensory data and the enormous scale of pervasive/ubiquitous devices that generate zettabytes of real-time data streams. Designing accurate models using such data streams, to revolutionize the decision-taking process, inaugurates pervasive computing as a worthy paradigm for a better quality-of-life (e.g., smart homes and self-driving cars.). The confluence of pervasive computing and artificial intelligence, namely Pervasive AI, expanded the role of ubiquitous IoT systems from mainly data collection to executing distributed computations with a promising alternative to centralized learning, presenting various challenges, including privacy and latency requirements. In this context, an intelligent resource scheduling should be envisaged among IoT devices (e.g., smartphones, smart vehicles) and infrastructure (e.g., edge nodes and base stations) to avoid communication and computation overheads and ensure maximum performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the recent techniques and strategies developed to overcome these resource challenges in pervasive AI systems. Specifically, we first present an overview of pervasive computing, its architecture, and its intersection with artificial intelligence. We then review the background, applications and performance metrics of AI, particularly Deep Learning (DL) and reinforcement learning, running in a ubiquitous system. Next, we provide a deep literature review of communication-efficient techniques, from both algorithmic and system perspectives, of distributed training and inference across the combination of IoT devices, edge devices and cloud servers. Finally, we discuss our future vision and research challenges.",

In this paper, we propose a Distributed Intelligent Video Surveillance (DIVS) system using Deep Learning (DL) algorithms and deploy it in an edge computing environment. We establish a multi-layer edge computing architecture and a distributed DL training model for the DIVS system. The DIVS system can migrate computing workloads from the network center to network edges to reduce huge network communication overhead and provide low-latency and accurate video analysis solutions. We implement the proposed DIVS system and address the problems of parallel training, model synchronization, and workload balancing. Task-level parallel and model-level parallel training methods are proposed to further accelerate the video analysis process. In addition, we propose a model parameter updating method to achieve model synchronization of the global DL model in a distributed EC environment. Moreover, a dynamic data migration approach is proposed to address the imbalance of workload and computational power of edge nodes. Experimental results showed that the EC architecture can provide elastic and scalable computing power, and the proposed DIVS system can efficiently handle video surveillance and analysis tasks.",

        "abstract": "This work investigates a realistic scenario when an on-line scheduler is needed to meet the requirement of latency even when the edge computing resources and communication speed are dynamically fluctuating, while protecting the privacy of users as well. Recently deep learning applications are thriving on edge and mobile computing scenarios, due to the concerns of latency constraints, data security and privacy, and other considerations. However, because of the limitation of power delivery, battery lifetime and computation resource, offering real-time neural network inference ability has to resort to the specialized energy-efficient architecture, and sometimes the coordination between the edge devices and the powerful cloud or fog facilities. This work investigates a realistic scenario when an on-line scheduler is needed to meet the requirement of latency even when the edge computing resources and communication speed are dynamically fluctuating, while protecting the privacy of users as well. It also leverages the approximate computing feature of neural networks and actively trade-off excessive neural network propagation paths for latency guarantee even when local resource provision is unstable. Combining neural network approximation and dynamic scheduling, the real-time deep learning system could adapt to different requirements of latency/accuracy and the resource fluctuation of mobile-cloud applications. Experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed scheduler significantly improves the energy efficiency of real-time neural networks on edge devices.",

        "abstract": "This paper develops a rigorous analysis on the privacy amplification provided by mixup either on samples or updates, where the hybrid structure of mixup and the Laplace Mechanism produces a new type of DP guarantee lying between Pure DP and Approximate DP. Information-theoretical privacy relies on randomness. Representatively, Differential Privacy (DP) has emerged as the gold standard to quantify the individual privacy preservation provided by given randomness. However, almost all randomness in existing differentially private optimization and learning algorithms is restricted to noise perturbation. In this paper, we set out to provide a privacy analysis framework to understand the privacy guarantee produced by other randomness commonly used in optimization and learning algorithms (e.g., parameter randomness). We take mixup: a random linear aggregation of inputs, as a concrete example. Our contributions are twofold. First, we develop a rigorous analysis on the privacy amplification provided by mixup either on samples or updates, where we find the hybrid structure of mixup and the Laplace Mechanism produces a new type of DP guarantee lying between Pure DP and Approximate DP. Such an average-case privacy amplification can produce tighter composition bounds. Second, both empirically and theoretically, we show that proper mixup comes almost free of utility compromise.",

Over the past five years a new approach to privacy-preserving data analysis has born fruit [13, 18, 7, 19, 5, 37, 35, 8, 32]. This approach differs from much (but not all!) of the related literature in the statistics, databases, theory, and cryptography communities, in that a formal and ad omnia privacy guarantee is defined, and the data analysis techniques presented are rigorously proved to satisfy the guarantee. The key privacy guarantee that has emerged is differential privacy. Roughly speaking, this ensures that (almost, and quantifiably) no risk is incurred by joining a statistical database. \n \nIn this survey, we recall the definition of differential privacy and two basic techniques for achieving it.

        "abstract": "Experimental evaluation of MM-MGSMO approach with existing methods attained improved performances with factors such as data allocation efficiency, false-positive rate, storage capacity compared with other cutting edge technologies such as Joint optimization algorithm and Game theory-based dynamic resource allocation strategy. Handling large data in geographically distributed information centers with resource and cost optimization is a key challenge. With several approaches being designed, handling a large volume of data in multiple datacenters in an inappropriate manner yet is considered to be a time-consuming process. To address these issues, a Multivariate Metaphor based Metaheuristic Glowworm Swarm Map-Reduce Optimization (MM-MGSMO) technique is presented. Here, with search space and large data volume as input for geo-distributed datacenters, glowworm (i.e. virtual machine) population is initialized. With each glowworm possessing a certain amount of luciferin (i.e. objective function), multiple objective functions (i.e. bandwidth, storage capacity, energy and computation cost) are defined for each virtual machine. Next, the glowworm position is updated according to the neighboring factor by means of probability. Followed by this, MapReduce function identifies the optimal virtual machine and accordingly allocation is performed, therefore improving data allocation efficiency. Besides, the workload is assigned across datacenters, reduction in computation cost and storage capacity is guaranteed. Experimental evaluation of MM-MGSMO approach with existing methods attained improved performances with factors such as data allocation efficiency, false-positive rate, storage capacity compared with other cutting edge technologies such as Joint optimization algorithm and Game theory-based dynamic resource allocation strategy.",

        "abstract": "A federated learning based model with privacy preservation of smart grids data using serverless cloud computing that considers the blockchain-enabled dew servers in each HAN for local data storage and local model training. The smart power grid is a critical energy infrastructure where real-time electricity usage data is collected to predict future energy requirements. The existing prediction models focus on the centralized frameworks, where the collected data from various home area networks (HANs) are forwarded to a central server. This process leads to cybersecurity threats. This article proposes a federated learning based model with privacy preservation of smart grids data using serverless cloud computing. The model considers the blockchain-enabled dew servers in each HAN for local data storage and local model training. Advanced perturbation and normalization techniques are used to reduce the inverse impact of irregular workload on the training results. The experiment conducted on benchmarks datasets demonstrates that the proposed model minimizes the computation and communication costs, attacking probability, and improves the test accuracy. Overall, the proposed model enables smart grids with robust privacy preservation and high accuracy.",

        "abstract": "This work designs an end-to-end trainable attentive multi-stream convolutional neural network (AMS-CNN) for crowd counting and obtains promising and better results in terms of MAE and RMSE as compared with state-of-the-art approaches. In recent years video-based crowd counting and density estimation (CCDE) have become essential for crowd analysis. Current approaches rarely exploit spatial\u2013temporal features for CCDE, and they also usually do not consider measures to minimize the frame's background influence for obtaining crowd density maps, which has resulted in lower performance in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Again, attention to individual feature set's response toward crowd counting is also neglected. To this end, we are motivated to design an end-to-end trainable attentive multi-stream convolutional neural network (AMS-CNN) for crowd counting. At first, a multi-stream CNN (MS-CNN) is designed to obtain crowd density maps. The MS-CNN comprises three streams to fuse deep spatial, temporal, and spatial foreground features from different cues of the crowd video dataset, like frames, the volume of frames, and foregrounds of frames. To improve the accuracy, we designed three stream-wise attention modules to generate attentive crowd density maps, and their relative average is obtained using a relative averaged attentive density-map (RAAD) layer. The relative averaged density map is concatenated with the MS-CNN output, followed by two-stage CNN blocks to get the final density map. The experiments are demonstrated on three publicly available crowd density video datasets: Mall, UCSD, and Venice. We obtained promising and better results in terms of MAE and RMSE as compared with state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a novel framework, called InterFaceGAN, for semantic face editing by interpreting the latent semantics learned by GANs, and finds that the latent code of well-trained generative models actually learns a disentangled representation after linear transformations. Despite the recent advance of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in high-fidelity image synthesis, there lacks enough understanding of how GANs are able to map a latent code sampled from a random distribution to a photo-realistic image. Previous work assumes the latent space learned by GANs follows a distributed representation but observes the vector arithmetic phenomenon. In this work, we propose a novel framework, called InterFaceGAN, for semantic face editing by interpreting the latent semantics learned by GANs. In this framework, we conduct a detailed study on how different semantics are encoded in the latent space of GANs for face synthesis. We find that the latent code of well-trained generative models actually learns a disentangled representation after linear transformations. We explore the disentanglement between various semantics and manage to decouple some entangled semantics with subspace projection, leading to more precise control of facial attributes. Besides manipulating gender, age, expression, and the presence of eyeglasses, we can even vary the face pose as well as fix the artifacts accidentally generated by GAN models. The proposed method is further applied to achieve real image manipulation when combined with GAN inversion methods or some encoder-involved models. Extensive results suggest that learning to synthesize faces spontaneously brings a disentangled and controllable facial attribute representation.",

        "abstract": "A probabilistic graphical model framework to explicitly mine the conditional dependences between these distinct sparse features of HSI classification, synthesized using simple tree structures which can be discriminatively learnt (even with limited training samples) for classification. A significant recent advance in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification relies on the observation that the spectral signature of a pixel can be represented by a sparse linear combination of training spectra from an overcomplete dictionary. A spatiospectral notion of sparsity is further captured by developing a joint sparsity model, wherein spectral signatures of pixels in a local spatial neighborhood (of the pixel of interest) are constrained to be represented by a common collection of training spectra, albeit with different weights. A challenging open problem is to effectively capture the class conditional correlations between these multiple sparse representations corresponding to different pixels in the spatial neighborhood. We propose a probabilistic graphical model framework to explicitly mine the conditional dependences between these distinct sparse features. Our graphical models are synthesized using simple tree structures which can be discriminatively learnt (even with limited training samples) for classification. Experiments on benchmark HSI data sets reveal significant improvements over existing approaches in classification rates as well as robustness to choice of training.",

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has attracted the formidable interest of the scientific community and has been applied to an increasing number of real-life applications to automatically extract the meaningful information from the corresponding high dimensional datasets. However, traditional autoencoders (AE) and restricted Boltzmann machines are computationally expensive and do not perform well due to the Hughes phenomenon which is observed in HSI since the ratio of the labeled training pixels on the number of bands is usually quite small. To overcome such problems, this paper exploits a multi-layer extreme learning machine-based autoencoder (MLELM-AE) for HSI classification. MLELM-AE learns feature representations by adopting a singular value decomposition and is used as basic building block for learning machine-based autoencoder (MLELM-AE). MLELM-AE method not only maintains the fast speed of traditional ELM but also greatly improves the performance of HSI classification. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MLELM-AE on several well-known HSI dataset.",

        "abstract": "Experimental results on several HSIs show that the proposed technique outperforms the linear sparsity-based classification technique, as well as the classical support vector machines and sparse kernel logistic regression classifiers. In this paper, a novel nonlinear technique for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is proposed. Our approach relies on sparsely representing a test sample in terms of all of the training samples in a feature space induced by a kernel function. For each test pixel in the feature space, a sparse representation vector is obtained by decomposing the test pixel over a training dictionary, also in the same feature space, by using a kernel-based greedy pursuit algorithm. The recovered sparse representation vector is then used directly to determine the class label of the test pixel. Projecting the samples into a high-dimensional feature space and kernelizing the sparse representation improve the data separability between different classes, providing a higher classification accuracy compared to the more conventional linear sparsity-based classification algorithms. Moreover, the spatial coherency across neighboring pixels is also incorporated through a kernelized joint sparsity model, where all of the pixels within a small neighborhood are jointly represented in the feature space by selecting a few common training samples. Kernel greedy optimization algorithms are suggested in this paper to solve the kernel versions of the single-pixel and multi-pixel joint sparsity-based recovery problems. Experimental results on several HSIs show that the proposed technique outperforms the linear sparsity-based classification technique, as well as the classical support vector machines and sparse kernel logistic regression classifiers.",

        "abstract": "A block diagonal representation learning algorithm (BDRLA) is proposed that generates a high-quality similarity matrix by approximating the initial affinity matrix and is directly applied to subsequent processing without extracting the clustering indicators. Hyperspectral band selection is viewed as an effective dimension reduction method. Recently, researchers present graph-based clustering for hyperspectral image (HSI) processing. However, most of them conduct clustering on a fixed data matrix so that it is sensitive to the quality of initial matrix. Moreover, these algorithms apply spectral clustering to obtain the final clustering result in increasing the time consumption. Based on these facts, we propose a block diagonal representation learning algorithm (BDRLA) in this article. BDRLA generates a high-quality similarity matrix by approximating the initial affinity matrix. Meanwhile, motivated to the spectral bands distance similarity matrix has a clear diagonal structure, a block diagonal similarity matrix with ordered partition points based upon the ${\\ell _{2}}$ -norm is constructed. By doing so, the obtained similarity matrix is directly applied to subsequent processing without extracting the clustering indicators. Additionally, to estimate the importance of bands, dictionary learning (DL) is adopted to select the representative band in each cluster. Extensive experiment results on three public datasets indicate that the bands selected by the proposed method achieve satisfactory performance.",

        "abstract": "A constrained version of HYCA (C-HYCA), in which all the parameters can be automatically estimated, which is an important aspect for practical application of the algorithm. Hyperspectral imaging relies on sophisticated acquisition and data processing systems able to acquire, process, store, and transmit hundreds or thousands of image bands from a given area of interest. In this paper, we exploit the high correlation existing among the components of the hyperspectral data sets to introduce a new compressive sensing methodology, termed hyperspectral coded aperture (HYCA), which largely reduces the number of measurements necessary to correctly reconstruct the original data. HYCA relies on two central properties of most hyperspectral images, usually termed data cubes: 1) the spectral vectors live on a low-dimensional subspace; and 2) the spectral bands present high correlation in both the spatial and the spectral domain. The former property allows to represent the data vectors using a small number of coordinates. In this paper, we particularly exploit the high spatial correlation mentioned in the latter property, which implies that each coordinate is piecewise smooth and thus compressible using local differences. The measurement matrix computes a small number of random projections for every spectral vector, which is connected with coded aperture schemes. The reconstruction of the data cube is obtained by solving a convex optimization problem containing a data term linked to the measurement matrix and a total variation regularizer. The solution of this optimization problem is obtained by an instance of the alternating direction method of multipliers that decomposes very hard problems into a cyclic sequence of simpler problems. In order to address the need to set up the parameters involved in the HYCA algorithm, we also develop a constrained version of HYCA (C-HYCA), in which all the parameters can be automatically estimated, which is an important aspect for practical application of the algorithm. A series of experiments with simulated and real data shows the effectiveness of HYCA and C-HYCA, indicating their potential in real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "A marginalized graph self-representation (MGSR) method for unsupervised hyperspectral band selection that generates the segmentations of an HSI by superpixel segmentation and records the relationships between adjacent pixels of the same segmentation in a structural graph. Unsupervised band selection is an essential step in preprocessing hyperspectral images (HSIs) to select informative bands. Most existing methods exploit the spatial information from the entire HSI while ignoring the difference between diverse homogeneous regions. Moreover, traditional methods utilize the limited size of data for model training that may result in degraded generalization performance. In this article, we propose a marginalized graph self-representation (MGSR) method for unsupervised hyperspectral band selection. To explore the spatial information from diverse homogenous regions, MGSR generates the segmentations of an HSI by superpixel segmentation and records the relationships between adjacent pixels of the same segmentation in a structural graph. Meanwhile, to improve the generalization and robustness, infinite corrupted samples are obtained from the original pixels by introducing noises in spectral bands for model training. To solve the proposed formulation, we design an alternating optimization algorithm to marginalize out the corruption and search for the optimal solution. Experimental studies on HSI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MGSR and the superiority over the state-of-the-art methods.

Witnessing the success of analysis dictionary learning (ADL)-based method in recent years, we propose an ADL-based supervised HSI classification method in this paper. In the proposed method, the dictionary is modeled considering both the characteristics within the spectrum and among the spectra. Specifically, to reduce the influence of strong nonlinearity within each spectrum on classification, we divide the spectrum into some segments, and based on this we propose HSI classification strategy. To preserve the relationships among spectra, similarities among pixels are introduced as constraints.

        "abstract": "The experimental results on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method successfully train models on distributed sequential data, while preserving privacy, and outperforms previous FL and centralized learning approaches in terms of achieving higher accuracy in fewer communication rounds. Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) are privacy-preserving Machine-Learning (ML) techniques that enable training ML models over data distributed among clients without requiring direct access to their raw data. Existing FL and SL approaches work on horizontally or vertically partitioned data and cannot handle sequentially partitioned data where segments of multiple-segment sequential data are distributed across clients. In this paper, we propose a novel federated split learning framework, FedSL, to train models on distributed sequential data. The most common ML models to train on sequential data are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Since the proposed framework is privacy preserving, segments of multiple-segment sequential data cannot be shared between clients or between clients and server. To circumvent this limitation, we propose a novel SL approach tailored for RNNs. A RNN is split into sub-networks, and each sub-network is trained on one client containing single segments of multiple-segment training sequences. During local training, the sub-networks on different clients communicate with each other to capture latent dependencies between consecutive segments of multiple-segment sequential data on different clients, but without sharing raw data or complete model parameters. After training local sub-networks with local sequential data segments, all clients send their sub-networks to a federated server where sub-networks are aggregated to generate a global model. The experimental results on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method successfully train models on distributed sequential data, while preserving privacy, and outperforms previous FL and centralized learning approaches in terms of achieving higher accuracy in fewer communication rounds.",

Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology is increasingly prominent in the current stage of social development. All walks of life have begun to implement the IoT integration technology, so as to strive to promote industrial modernization, intelligence, and digitalization. In this case, how to link high-risk network activities with entities has become the primary issue for promoting industrial development. However, at this stage, the security issues in the development of the IoT technology have contradictions that are difficult to resolve. According to this situation, how to make system defense intelligent and replace manual monitoring has become the future of the development of security architecture. This article combines existing security research to explore the possibility of deep learning (DL) in upgrading the IoT security architecture, discusses how the IoT can identify and respond to cyber attacks, and how to encrypt edge data transmission. Moreover, this article discusses security research in application fields, such as Industrial IoT, Internet of Vehicles, smart grid, smart home, and smart medical. Then, we summarized the areas that can be improved in future technological development, including sharing computing power through the edge network processing unit (NPU) central device and closely combining the environmental simulation model with the actual environment, as well as malicious code detection, intrusion detection, production safety, vulnerability detection, fault diagnosis, and blockchain technology.",

        "abstract": "A novel platform architecture to deploy a zero touch PAI as a service (PAlaaS) in 6G networks supported by a blockchain-based smart system is introduced and a federated-learning-as-a-service use case is presented where the ability of the proposed system to self-optimize and self-adapt to the dynamics of6G networks is evaluated in addition to minimizing the users' perceived costs. The vision of the upcoming 6G technologies, characterized by ultra-dense networks, low latency, and fast data rate, is to support pervasive artificial intelligence (PAI) using zero touch solutions enabling self-X (e.g., self-configuration, self-monitoring, and self-healing) services. However, the research on 6G is still in its infancy, and only the first steps have been taken to conceptualize its design, investigate its implementation, and plan for use cases. Toward this end, academia and industry communities have gradually shifted from theoretical studies of AI distribution to real-world deployment and standardization. Still, designing an end-to-end framework that systematizes the AI distribution by allowing easier access to the service using a third-party application assisted by zero touch service provisioning has not been well explored. In this context, we introduce a novel platform architecture to deploy a zero touch PAI as a service (PAlaaS) in 6G networks supported by a blockchain-based smart system. This platform aims to standardize the PAI at all levels of the architecture and unify the interfaces in order to facilitate service deployment across application and infrastructure domains, relieve users' worries about cost, security, and resource allocation, and at the same time respect the 6G's stringent performance requirements. As a proof of concept, we present a federated-learning-as-a-service use case where we evaluate the ability of our proposed system to self-optimize and self-adapt to the dynamics of 6G networks in addition to minimizing the users' perceived costs.",

From the mutual empowerment of two high-speed development technologies: artificial intelligence and edge computing, we propose a tailored Edge Intelligent Video Surveillance (EIVS) system. It is a scalable edge computing architecture and uses multitask deep learning for relevant computer vision tasks. Due to the potential application of different surveillance devices are widely different, we adopt a smart IoT module to normalize the video data of different cameras, thus the EIVS system can conveniently found proper data for a specific task. In addition, the deep learning models can be deployed at every EIVS nodes, to make computer vision tasks on the normalized data. Meanwhile, due to the training and deploying of deep learning model are usually separated, for the related tasks in the same scenario, we propose to collaboratively train the depth learning models in a multitask paradigm on the cloud server. The simulation results on the publicly available datasets show that the system continuously supports intelligent monitoring tasks, has good scalability, and can improve performance through multitask learning.",

        "abstract": "This work describes how several common DNNs, when subjected to state-of-the art optimizations, trade off accuracy for resource use such as memory, computation, and energy, and introduces two new and powerful DNN optimizations that exploit it. We consider applying computer vision to video on cloud-backed mobile devices using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The computational demands of DNNs are high enough that, without careful resource management, such applications strain device battery, wireless data, and cloud cost budgets. We pose the corresponding resource management problem, which we call Approximate Model Scheduling, as one of serving a stream of heterogeneous (i.e., solving multiple classification problems) requests under resource constraints. We present the design and implementation of an optimizing compiler and runtime scheduler to address this problem. Going beyond traditional resource allocators, we allow each request to be served approximately, by systematically trading off DNN classification accuracy for resource use, and remotely, by reasoning about on-device/cloud execution trade-offs. To inform the resource allocator, we characterize how several common DNNs, when subjected to state-of-the art optimizations, trade off accuracy for resource use such as memory, computation, and energy. The heterogeneous streaming setting is a novel one for DNN execution, and we introduce two new and powerful DNN optimizations that exploit it. Using the challenging continuous mobile vision domain as a case study, we show that our techniques yield significant reductions in resource usage and perform effectively over a broad range of operating conditions.",

This work studies the distributed empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem under differential privacy (DP) constraint. Existing algorithms achieve DP typically by perturbing every local full gradient with noise, leading to significantly degenerated utility compared to centralized algorithms. To tackle this issue, we first introduce a node sampling strategy to distributed ERM, where a small fraction of nodes are randomly selected at each iteration to perform optimization. Then, we develop a class of distributed dual averaging (DDA) algorithms under this framework, where only the stochastic subgradients over individual data samples within the activated nodes are perturbed to amplify the DP guarantee. We prove that the proposed algorithms have utility loss comparable to existing centralized private algorithms for both general and strongly convex problems. When removing the noise, our algorithm attains the optimal O(1/t) convergence for non-smooth stochastic optimization. Finally, experimental results on two benchmark datasets are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

        "abstract": "This work examines fundamental limitations of differentially private procedures when the goal is to release a sparse histogram, or a contingency table, and describes error bounds when thegoal is model selection for a private contingency table and proposes a relaxed privacy definition called random differential privacy (RDP). Differential privacy is a relatively recent development in the field of privacy-preserving data mining, which was formulated to give a mathematically rigorous definition of privacy. The concept has spawned a great deal of work regarding the development of algorithms which are privacy-preserving under this definition, and also work which seeks to understand the fundamental limitations of such algorithms. When the goal is statistical inference it is important to understand what set of analyses may be carried out in the privacy-preserving framework with reasonable accuracy, and which data summaries and results may be reported. In this work we begin by examining fundamental limitations of differentially private procedures when the goal is to release a sparse histogram, or a contingency table. We also describe error bounds when the goal is model selection for a private contingency table. Through examples we will demonstrate the implications of these lower error bounds for statistical analysis with datasets of different sizes and dimensions. Thus far, differentially private algorithms appear to be restricted to the release of finite dimensional vectors (e.g., regression coefficients, point estimates, SVM parameters). We next develop methods for releasing functional data while preserving differential privacy. Specifically, we show that when the function of interest lies inside a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, then it satisfies differential privacy to release the function plus a Gaussian process noise term. As examples we consider kernel density estimation, kernel support vector machines, and suitably smooth functions which lie in a particular Sobolev space. Finally we propose a relaxed privacy definition called random differential privacy (RDP). Differential privacy requires that adding any new observation to a database will have small effect on the output of the data-release procedure. Random differential privacy requires that adding a randomly drawn new observation to a database will have small effect on the output. We show an analog of the composition property of differentially private procedures which applies to our new definition. We show how to release an RDP histogram and we show that RDP histograms are much more accurate than histograms obtained using ordinary differential privacy. We finally show an analog of the global sensitivity framework for the release of functions under our privacy definition. We demonstrate that an extension of this idea and describe how it relates to other looser privacy definitions that have begun appearing in the literature.",

        "abstract": "A blockchain-based distributed federated learning technique for energy-demand prediction that combines FL with blockchain to provide data privacy and trust features for energy prosumers is proposed. The participation of prosumers in demand-response programs is essential for the success of demand-side management in renewable-powered energy grids. Unfortunately, the engagement is still low due to concerns related to the privacy of their energy data used in the prediction processes. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based distributed federated learning (FL) technique for energy-demand prediction that combines FL with blockchain to provide data privacy and trust features for energy prosumers. The privacy-sensitive energy data are stored locally at edge prosumer nodes without revealing it to third parties, with only the learned local model weights being shared using a blockchain network. The global federated model is not centralized but distributed and replicated over the blockchain overlay, ensuring the model immutability and provenance of parameter updates. We had proposed smart contracts to deal with the integration of local machine-learning prediction models with the blockchain, defining functions for the model parameters\u2019 scaling and reduction of blockchain overhead. The centralized, local-edge, and blockchain-integrated models are comparatively evaluated for prediction of energy demand 24 h ahead using a multi-layer perceptron model and the monitored energy data of several prosumers. The results show only a slight decrease in prediction accuracy in the case of blockchain-based distributed FL with reliable data privacy support compared with the centralized learning solution.",

Crowd panic detection (CPD) is crucial to control crowd disasters. The recent CPD approaches fail to address crowd shape change due to perspective distortion in the frame and across the frames. To this end, we are motivated to design a simple but most effective model known as multiscale spatial-temporal atrous-net and principal component analysis (PCA) guided one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM), i.e., MuST-POS for the CPD. The proposed model utilizes two multiscale atrous-net to extract multiscale spatial and multiscale temporal features to model crowd scenes. Then we adopted PCA to reduce the dimension of the extracted multiscale features and fed them into an OC-SVM for modeling normal crowd scenes. The outliers of the OC-SVM are treated as crowd panic behavior. Three publicly available datasets: the UMN, the MED, and the Pets-2009, are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed MuST-POS. The MuST-POS achieves the detection accuracy of 99.40%, 97.61%, and 98.37% on the UMN, the MED, and the Pets-2009 datasets, respectively, and performs better to recent state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "A framework called InterFaceGAN is proposed to interpret the disentangled face representation learned by the state-of-the-art GAN models and study the properties of the facial semantics encoded in the latent space to suggest that learning to synthesize faces spontaneously brings a disentangling and controllable face representation. Although generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made significant progress in face synthesis, there lacks enough understanding of what GANs have learned in the latent representation to map a random code to a photo-realistic image. In this work, we propose a framework called InterFaceGAN to interpret the disentangled face representation learned by the state-of-the-art GAN models and study the properties of the facial semantics encoded in the latent space. We first find that GANs learn various semantics in some linear subspaces of the latent space. After identifying these subspaces, we can realistically manipulate the corresponding facial attributes without retraining the model. We then conduct a detailed study on the correlation between different semantics and manage to better disentangle them via subspace projection, resulting in more precise control of the attribute manipulation. Besides manipulating the gender, age, expression, and presence of eyeglasses, we can even alter the face pose and fix the artifacts accidentally made by GANs. Furthermore, we perform an in-depth face identity analysis and a layer-wise analysis to evaluate the editing results quantitatively. Finally, we apply our approach to real face editing by employing GAN inversion approaches and explicitly training feed-forward models based on the synthetic data established by InterFaceGAN. Extensive experimental results suggest that learning to synthesize faces spontaneously brings a disentangled and controllable face representation.",

        "abstract": "Considering that regions of different scales incorporate the complementary yet correlated information for classification, a multiscale adaptive sparse representation (MASR) model is proposed and demonstrates the qualitative and quantitative superiority of the proposed MASR algorithm when compared to several well-known classifiers. Sparse representation has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool in classification of hyperspectral images (HSIs). The spatial context of an HSI can be exploited by first defining a local region for each test pixel and then jointly representing pixels within each region by a set of common training atoms (samples). However, the selection of the optimal region scale (size) for different HSIs with different types of structures is a nontrivial task. In this paper, considering that regions of different scales incorporate the complementary yet correlated information for classification, a multiscale adaptive sparse representation (MASR) model is proposed. The MASR effectively exploits spatial information at multiple scales via an adaptive sparse strategy. The adaptive sparse strategy not only restricts pixels from different scales to be represented by training atoms from a particular class but also allows the selected atoms for these pixels to be varied, thus providing an improved representation. Experiments on several real HSI data sets demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative superiority of the proposed MASR algorithm when compared to several well-known classifiers.",

        "abstract": "Experiments on two real HSIs demonstrate that the features learned by EMO-ELM not only preserve better sparsity but also achieve superior separability than many existing feature learning methods. Hyperspectral image (HSI) consists of hundreds of narrow spectral band components with rich spectral and spatial information. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has been widely used for HSI analysis. However, the classical ELM is difficult to use for sparse feature leaning due to its randomly generated hidden layer. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised sparse feature learning approach, called Evolutionary Multiobjective-based ELM (EMO-ELM), and apply it to HSI feature extraction. Specifically, we represent the task of constructing the ELM Autoencoder (ELM-AE) as a multiobjective optimization problem that takes the sparsity of hidden layer outputs and the reconstruction error as two conflicting objectives. Then, we adopt an Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (EMO) method to solve the two objectives, simultaneously. To find the best solution from the Pareto solution set and construct the best trade-off feature extractor, a curvature-based method is proposed to focus on the knee area of the Pareto solutions. Benefited from the EMO, the proposed EMO-ELM is less prone to fall into a local minimum and has fewer trainable parameters than gradient-based AEs. Experiments on two real HSIs demonstrate that the features learned by EMO-ELM not only preserve better sparsity but also achieve superior separability than many existing feature learning methods.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a nonlinear kernel-based target detection algorithm for hyperspectral images. The proposed approach relies on the sparse representation of an unknown sample with respect to both background and target training samples in a high-dimensional feature space induced by a kernel function. The sparse representation vector can be recovered via a kernelized greedy algorithm, where the kernel trick is used to avoid explicit evaluations of the data in the feature space. The spatial smoothness in hyperspectral images is also taken into account through a kernelized joint sparsity model. The detection decision is then made by comparing the reconstruction accuracy in terms of the background and target sub-dictionaries. The detection algorithm in a high-dimensional feature space implicitly exploits the higher-order structure (correlations) within the data which cannot be captured by a linear model. Therefore, projecting the pixels into a kernel feature space and kernelizing the linear sparse representation model improves the separability between the background and target classes, leading to a more accurate detection performance.",

        "abstract": "Experimental results show that the improved sparse subspace clustering method has the second shortest computational time and also outperforms the other six methods in classification accuracy when using an appropriate band number obtained by the DC plot algorithm. An improved sparse subspace clustering (ISSC) method is proposed to select an appropriate band subset for hyperspectral imagery (HSI) classification. The ISSC assumes that band vectors are sampled from a union of low-dimensional orthogonal subspaces and each band can be sparsely represented as a linear or affine combination of other bands within its subspace. First, the ISSC represents band vectors with sparse coefficient vectors by solving the L2-norm optimization problem using the least square regression (LSR) algorithm. The sparse and block diagonal structure of the coefficient matrix from LSR leads to correct segmentation of band vectors. Second, the angular similarity measurement is presented and utilized to construct the similarity matrix. Third, the distribution compactness (DC) plot algorithm is used to estimate an appropriate size of the band subset. Finally, spectral clustering is implemented to segment the similarity matrix and the desired ISSC band subset is found. Four groups of experiments on three widely used HSI datasets are performed to test the performance of ISSC for selecting bands in classification. In addition, the following six state-of-the-art band selection methods are used to make comparisons: linear constrained minimum variance-based band correlation constraint (LCMV-BCC), affinity propagation (AP), spectral information divergence (SID), maximum-variance principal component analysis (MVPCA), sparse representation-based band selection (SpaBS), and sparse nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF). Experimental results show that the ISSC has the second shortest computational time and also outperforms the other six methods in classification accuracy when using an appropriate band number obtained by the DC plot algorithm.",

        "abstract": "A new technique similar to HYCA which does not require the knowledge of the subspace in advance is presented; the proposed technique is termed blind HYCA (B-HYCA) and it performs a form of blind hyperspectral compressed sensing. Compressive Sensing has raised as a very useful way to save costs in the acquisition equipment due to the fact that with this technique we can measure the signal in an already compressed form. This is very interesting in hyperspectral applications due to the large amount of data that the hyper-spectral sensors collect, store and transmit to the ground stations. Over the last years many compressive sensing methods have been applied to hyperspectral images, and others have been proposed for exploiting the unique features of this kind of images. Over the last years, many techniques have been proposed to perform compressive sensing in hyperspectral imaging. One of them is the Hyperspectral Coded Aperture (HYCA), which exploits two characteristics of hyper-spectral imagery: 1) the hyperspectral vectors belong to a low dimensional subspace, and 2) the data cube components exhibit very high correlation in the spatial and in the spectral domains. However, HYCA requires the knowledge of the subspace in advance, which, very often, may compromise its applicability. In this paper it is presented a new technique similar to HYCA which does not require the knowledge of the subspace in advance; the proposed technique is termed blind HYCA (B-HYCA) and it performs a form of blind hyperspectral compressed sensing.",

        "abstract": "A robust dual graph self-representation method for unsupervised band selection that uses a superpixel segmentation technique to generate homogenous regions of each HSI to extract spatial information and an iterative optimization algorithm is designed to solve the proposed formulation. Unsupervised band selection aims to select informative spectral bands to preprocess hyperspectral images (HSIs) without using labels. Traditional band selection methods only work well on Euclidean data, but ignore structural information of pixels and spectral bands. Moreover, they treat each HSI as a whole to exploit latent spatial information while ignoring the difference in spatial distribution between diverse homogeneous regions. In this article, we propose a robust dual graph self-representation (RDGSR) method for unsupervised band selection. RDGSR uses a superpixel segmentation technique to generate homogenous regions of each HSI to extract spatial information. Based on the segmentation result, the superpixel-based similarity graph and band-based similarity graph are constructed from HSIs to record spatial and structural information. With this knowledge, the dual graph convolution is developed and the $\\ell _{2,1}$ -norm is introduced in the loss function and regularization term to eliminate the noise in rows for robust and effective band selection. The novelty of RDGSR is the joint utilization of the geometric structure of pixels with spatial consistency and the geometric structure of spectral bands to enhance the performance of band selection in a robust $\\ell _{2,1}$ -norm manner. An iterative optimization algorithm is designed to solve the proposed formulation. Substantial experiments on HSI datasets are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed RDGSR over the state-of-the-art methods.

        "abstract": "A new dictionary learning method is introduced to balance the discrimination and reconstruction of training samples and can further improve the discrimination of dictionary items due to the reduced categories in each subimage and reduce the computation cost. Supervised dictionary learning and representation (S-DLR) learning framework has demonstrated its superiority for hyperspectral image classification. Relaxed collaborative representation (RCR) has also been acknowledged as an effective method in balancing the similarity and difference between features. In this article, a new dictionary learning method is introduced to balance the discrimination and reconstruction of training samples. In the dictionary learning stage, two new indicators are designed to measure the discriminability of items and can be improved by optimizing coding coefficients. The imposed $l_{2}$ -norm between the independent item and the mean of class-specific samples constrains the similarity, and the calculated weights measure the difference. In the label determination stage, considering that the residuals of RCR are adversely affected by the significant difference of features, a new classification approach is introduced. Class labels are assigned without calculating the reconstruction errors but calculating the levels of comprehensive contribution from all training samples instead. Since the effectiveness will be degraded when dealing with more complex circumstances, a region-based version is further introduced. It can further improve the discrimination of dictionary items due to the reduced categories in each subimage and reduce the computation cost. The experimental results on several hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that our methods can effectively improve the classification performance.",

        "abstract": "The subjective and objective performance of proposed hybrid network resulted in superior performance as compared to state-of-art approaches in terms of overall accuracy (OA), average accuracy (AA), precision, recall and F1-score. Hyperspectral images (HSI) are playing a dominant role in many applications as they contain high spectral and spatial information. The HSIs contain hundreds of attached spatial-spectral bands. The extraction of joint spectral-spatial features becomes a difficult task due to the correlation between bands. The deep learning models provide a solution to the extraction of spatial-spectral features by introducing various kernels. Thus, this article is focused on the implementation of deep learning convolutional neural network (DLCNN) based feature extraction with a bio-optimization-based feature selection mechanism. Initially, enhanced guided image filtering (EGIF) is developed to extract the spatial features. In addition, Residual Network 50 (ResNet50) is introduced to extract the color-based three-dimensional spectral features from the HSI dataset. Finally, DLCNN is applied to classify the various bands of HSI. The subjective and objective performance of proposed hybrid network resulted in superior performance as compared to state-of-art approaches in terms of overall accuracy (OA), average accuracy (AA), precision, recall and F1-score.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a new approach that uses SL architecture with an LSTM network to classify time-series data with multiple clients and has achieved better or reasonable accuracy compared to the Split-1DCNN method using the electrocardiogram dataset and the human activity recognition dataset. Federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) are the two popular distributed machine learning (ML) approaches that provide some data privacy protection mechanisms. In the time-series classification problem, many researchers typically use 1D convolutional neural networks (1DCNNs) based on the SL approach with a single client to reduce the computational overhead at the client-side while still preserving data privacy. Another method, recurrent neural network (RNN), is utilized on sequentially partitioned data where segments of multiple-segment sequential data are distributed across various clients. However, to the best of our knowledge, it is still not much work done in SL with long shortterm memory (LSTM) network, even the LSTM network is practically effective in processing time-series data. In this work, we propose a new approach, LSTMSPLIT, that uses SL architecture with an LSTM network to classify time-series data with multiple clients. The differential privacy (DP) is applied to solve the data privacy leakage. The proposed method, LSTMSPLIT, has achieved better or reasonable accuracy compared to the Split-1DCNN method using the electrocardiogram dataset and the human activity recognition dataset. Furthermore, the proposed method, LSTMSPLIT, can also achieve good accuracy after applying differential privacy to preserve the user privacy of the cut layer of the",

The internet is a booming sector for exchanging information because of all the gadgets in today\u2019s world. Attacks on Internet of Things (IoT) devices are alarming as these devices evolve. The two primary areas of the IoT that should be secure in terms of authentication, authorization, and data privacy are the IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) and the IoV (Internet of Vehicles). IoMT and IoV devices monitor real-time healthcare and traffic trends to protect an individual\u2019s life. With the proliferation of these devices comes a rise in security assaults and threats, necessitating the deployment of an IPS (intrusion prevention system) for these systems. As a result, machine learning and deep learning technologies are utilized to identify and control security in IoMT and IoV devices. This research study aims to investigate the research fields of current IoT security research trends. Papers about the domain were searched, and the top 50 papers were selected. In addition, research objectives are specified concerning the problem, which leads to research questions. After evaluating the associated research, data is retrieved from digital archives. Furthermore, based on the findings of this SLR, a taxonomy of IoT subdomains has been given. This article also identifies the difficult areas and suggests ideas for further research in the IoT.",

        "abstract": "A framework for Distributed AI as a Service (DAIaaS) provisioning for Internet of Everything (IoE) and 6G environments is proposed to facilitate standardization of distributed AI provisioning, allow developers to focus on the domain-specific details without worrying about distributed training and inference, and help systemize the mass-production of technologies for smarter environments. Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken us by storm, helping us to make decisions in everything we do, even in finding our \u201ctrue love\u201d and the \u201csignificant other\u201d. While 5G promises us high-speed mobile internet, 6G pledges to support ubiquitous AI services through next-generation softwarization, heterogeneity, and configurability of networks. The work on 6G is in its infancy and requires the community to conceptualize and develop its design, implementation, deployment, and use cases. Towards this end, this paper proposes a framework for Distributed AI as a Service (DAIaaS) provisioning for Internet of Everything (IoE) and 6G environments. The AI service is \u201cdistributed\u201d because the actual training and inference computations are divided into smaller, concurrent, computations suited to the level and capacity of resources available with cloud, fog, and edge layers. Multiple DAIaaS provisioning configurations for distributed training and inference are proposed to investigate the design choices and performance bottlenecks of DAIaaS. Specifically, we have developed three case studies (e.g., smart airport) with eight scenarios (e.g., federated learning) comprising nine applications and AI delivery models (smart surveillance, etc.) and 50 distinct sensor and software modules (e.g., object tracker). The evaluation of the case studies and the DAIaaS framework is reported in terms of end-to-end delay, network usage, energy consumption, and financial savings with recommendations to achieve higher performance. DAIaaS will facilitate standardization of distributed AI provisioning, allow developers to focus on the domain-specific details without worrying about distributed training and inference, and help systemize the mass-production of technologies for smarter environments.",

        "abstract": "The MDED framework leverages Docker-based containers and Kubernetes orchestration to obtain a pedestrian-detection deep learning model with a speed of up to 19 FPS, satisfying the semi-real-time condition. The demand for deep learning frameworks capable of running in edge computing environments is rapidly increasing due to the exponential growth of data volume and the need for real-time processing. However, edge computing environments often have limited resources, necessitating the distribution of deep learning models. Distributing deep learning models can be challenging as it requires specifying the resource type for each process and ensuring that the models are lightweight without performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose the Microservice Deep-learning Edge Detection (MDED) framework, designed for easy deployment and distributed processing in edge computing environments. The MDED framework leverages Docker-based containers and Kubernetes orchestration to obtain a pedestrian-detection deep learning model with a speed of up to 19 FPS, satisfying the semi-real-time condition. The framework employs an ensemble of high-level feature-specific networks (HFN) and low-level feature-specific networks (LFN) trained on the MOT17Det dataset, achieving an accuracy improvement of up to AP50 and AP0.18 on MOT20Det data.",

        "abstract": "A simple and effective heuristic approach that keeps low response delay and satisfies the requirement on processing throughput and an advanced deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach that learns to schedule from experience are proposed. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are popular in diverse fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. DNN inference tasks are emerging as a service provided by cloud computing environments. However, cloud-hosted DNN inference faces new challenges in workload scheduling for the best Quality of Service (QoS), due to dependence on batch size, model complexity and resource allocation. This paper represents the QoS metric as a utility function of response delay and inference accuracy. We first propose a simple and effective heuristic approach that keeps low response delay and satisfies the requirement on processing throughput. Then we describe an advanced deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach that learns to schedule from experience. The RL scheduler is trained to maximize QoS, using a set of system statuses as the input to the RL policy model. Our approach performs scheduling actions only when there are free GPUs, thus reduces scheduling overhead over common RL schedulers that run at every continuous time step. We evaluate the schedulers on a simulation platform and demonstrate the advantages of RL over heuristics.",

Privacy-preserving, and more concretely differentially private machine learning, is concerned with hiding specific details in training datasets which contain sensitive information. Many proposed differentially private machine learning algorithms have promising theoretical properties, such as convergence to non-private performance in the limit of infinite data, computational efficiency, and polynomial sample complexity. Unfortunately, these properties have not always translated to real-world applications of private machine learning methods, which is why their adoption by practitioners has been slow. For many typical problems and sample sizes classification accuracy has been unsatisfactory. Through feature selection which preserves end-to-end privacy, this work has demonstrated that private machine learning algorithms can indeed be useful in practice. In particular, we propose a new feature selection mechanism, which fits well with the design constraints imposed by differential privacy, and allows for improved scalability of private classifiers in realistic settings. We investigate differentially private Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression and show non-trivial performance on a number of datasets. Significant empirical evidence suggests that the number of features and number of hyperparameters can be determining factors of the performance of differentially private classifiers.",

Complex expressions are the basis of data analytics. To process complex expressions on big data efficiently, we developed a novel optimization strategy for parallel computation platforms such as Hadoop and Spark. We attempted to minimize the rounds of data repartition to achieve high performance. Aiming at this goal, we modeled the expression as a graph and developed a simplification algorithm for this graph. Based on the graph, we converted the round minimization problem into a graph decomposition problem and developed a linear algorithm for it. We also designed appropriated implementation for the optimization strategy.

        "abstract": "The results show that the blockchain based distributed demand side management can be used for matching energy demand and production at smart grid level, the demand response signal being followed with high accuracy, while the amount of energy flexibility needed for convergence is reduced. In this paper, we investigate the use of decentralized blockchain mechanisms for delivering transparent, secure, reliable, and timely energy flexibility, under the form of adaptation of energy demand profiles of Distributed Energy Prosumers, to all the stakeholders involved in the flexibility markets (Distribution System Operators primarily, retailers, aggregators, etc.). In our approach, a blockchain based distributed ledger stores in a tamper proof manner the energy prosumption information collected from Internet of Things smart metering devices, while self-enforcing smart contracts programmatically define the expected energy flexibility at the level of each prosumer, the associated rewards or penalties, and the rules for balancing the energy demand with the energy production at grid level. Consensus based validation will be used for demand response programs validation and to activate the appropriate financial settlement for the flexibility providers. The approach was validated using a prototype implemented in an Ethereum platform using energy consumption and production traces of several buildings from literature data sets. The results show that our blockchain based distributed demand side management can be used for matching energy demand and production at smart grid level, the demand response signal being followed with high accuracy, while the amount of energy flexibility needed for convergence is reduced.",

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently advanced image synthesis by learning the underlying distribution of the observed data. However, how the features learned from solving the task of image generation are applicable to other vision tasks remains seldom explored. In this work, we show that learning to synthesize images can bring remarkable hierarchical visual features that are generalizable across a wide range of applications. Specifically, we consider the pre-trained StyleGAN generator as a learned loss function and utilize its layer-wise representation to train a novel hierarchical encoder. The visual feature produced by our encoder, termed as Generative Hierarchical Feature (GH-Feat), has strong transferability to both generative and discriminative tasks, including image editing, image harmonization, image classification, face verification, landmark detection, and layout prediction. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the appealing performance of GH-Feat.1",

        "abstract": "Experiments demonstrate that the proposed MURASR is superior to MASR and union region is better than the patch in the sparse representation, and the union region, which is the overlap of patch and superpixel, can make full use of the advantages of both and overcome the weaknesses of each one. Sparse Representation has been widely applied to classification of hyperspectral images (HSIs). Besides spectral information, the spatial context in HSIs also plays an important role in the classification. The recently published Multiscale Adaptive Sparse Representation (MASR) classifier has shown good performance in exploiting spatial information for HSI classification. But the spatial information is exploited by multiscale patches with fixed sizes of square windows. The patch can include all nearest neighbor pixels but these neighbor pixels may contain some noise pixels. Then another research proposed a Multiscale Superpixel-Based Sparse Representation (MSSR) classifier. Shape-adaptive superpixels can provide more accurate representation than patches. But it is difficult to select scales for superpixels. Therefore, inspired by the merits and demerits of multiscale patches and superpixels, we propose a novel algorithm called Multiscale Union Regions Adaptive Sparse Representation (MURASR). The union region, which is the overlap of patch and superpixel, can make full use of the advantages of both and overcome the weaknesses of each one. Experiments on several HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed MURASR is superior to MASR and union region is better than the patch in the sparse representation.",

        "abstract": "Experimental results showed that the N-RKGCSC model could eliminate the interference of additive and multiplicative noise well, achieving better segmentation performance and better noise immunity. Abstract. Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering is a challenging task due to its containing rich spectral information and spatial features. Subspace clustering has been used to explore the intrinsic connections between data points successfully. Graph convolutional subspace clustering (GCSC) was used to achieve robust HSI clustering. The model remaps the self-expressions of the data to non-Euclidean domains to generate a robust graph embedding dictionary. The efficient kernel graph convolutional subspace clustering model utilizes a subspace clustering model with the Frobenius norm and a Gaussian kernel function to achieve a globally optimal closed-form solution that is easy to implement, train, and apply. To reduce the impact of image noise on the segmentation effect, we consider spatial nonlocal self-similarity using nonlocal information blocks based on the fact that the spectral features of HSIs lie in low-dimensional subspaces. At the same time, the three-dimensional tensor generated by the nonlocal similar image blocks is estimated using a robust statistic function. Principal component analysis is used to remove the redundant information of hyperspectral data and extract the main features of pixels. Then a robust statistical function and nonlocal information block are used to construct the affinity matrix. The redundant information prevalent in the whole natural image is used for denoising, that is, the image block is taken as the unit to find similar areas in the image, then these regions are weighted and averaged. Since all pixels in the image are used, the noise can be better filtered. Finally, the constructed affinity matrix is applied to spectral clustering to obtain better clustering results. The model used is called nonlocal mean robust statistical kernel graph convolutional subspace clustering (N-RKGCSC). Experimental results on Salinas, Indian Pines, Pavia Center, and Pavia University datasets showed that the N-RKGCSC model could eliminate the interference of additive and multiplicative noise well, achieving better segmentation performance and better noise immunity.",

This paper proposes a target detector based on kernel sparse and spatial constraint for hyperspectral imagery (HSI). Due to the nonlinear and structural features of HSI data, sparse representation and spatial constraint are taken into consideration. Firstly, we construct a dictionary to represent the target pixels within a small neighborhood by a linear combination of samples. Then, these targets pixels are projected into the high-dimensional feature space through kernel function and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) are kernelized to obtain recovered sparse coefficient vector. By comparing the residuals of background and target to determine the type of pixel, the preliminary detection result can be achieved. Lastly, a spatial over-complete basis matrix is used to revise the initial detection result. The experimental results show that the proposed detector has better detection performance than several typical detectors.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a novel constrained detection algorithm, referred to as Sparse-SpatialCEM, to simultaneously force the sparsity and spatial correlation of the detection output via proper regularizations. The constrained energy minimization (CEM) algorithm is widely used for target detection in hyperspectral imagery. This method, as well as most target detection algorithms, focuses on the use of spectral information and neglects the spatial information embedded in images. In real hyperspectral images, it is usual that targets of interest only occupy a minor portion of the pixels, and an object may consist of multiple consecutive pixels in space. Considering these facts, we propose a novel constrained detection algorithm, referred to as Sparse-SpatialCEM, to simultaneously force the sparsity and spatial correlation of the detection output via proper regularizations. Several algorithms, including the CEM, SparseCEM, and constrained magnitude minimization algorithms, are limiting cases of the proposed framework. The formulated problems are solved by using the alternating direction method of multipliers. We validate the proposed algorithms and illustrate its advantages via both synthetic and real hyperspectral data.",

        "abstract": "A new camera architecture is developed that employs a digital micromirror array to perform optical calculations of linear projections of an image onto pseudorandom binary patterns that can be adapted to image at wavelengths that are currently impossible with conventional CCD and CMOS imagers. Compressive Sensing is an emerging field based on the revelation that a small number of linear projections of a compressible signal contain enough information for reconstruction and processing. It has many promising implications and enables the design of new kinds of Compressive Imaging systems and cameras. In this paper, we develop a new camera architecture that employs a digital micromirror array to perform optical calculations of linear projections of an image onto pseudorandom binary patterns. Its hallmarks include the ability to obtain an image with a single detection element while sampling the image fewer times than the number of pixels. Other attractive properties include its universality, robustness, scalability, progressivity, and computational asymmetry. The most intriguing feature of the system is that, since it relies on a single photon detector, it can be adapted to image at wavelengths that are currently impossible with conventional CCD and CMOS imagers.",

        "abstract": "Experimental results demonstrate that the bands selected by the enhanced FDPC approach could achieve higher classification accuracy than the FDPC and other state-of-the-art band selection techniques, whereas the isolated-point-stopping criterion is a reasonable way to determine the preferable number of bands to be selected. Through imaging the same spatial area by hyperspectral sensors at different spectral wavelengths simultaneously, the acquired hyperspectral imagery often contains hundreds of band images, which provide the possibility to accurately analyze and identify a ground object. However, due to the difficulty of obtaining sufficient labeled training samples in practice, the high number of spectral bands unavoidably leads to the problem of a \u201cdimensionality disaster\u201d (also called the Hughes phenomenon), and dimensionality reduction should be applied. Concerning band (or feature) selection, conventional methods choose the representative bands by ranking the bands with defined metrics (such as non-Gaussianity) or by formulating the band selection problem as a clustering procedure. Because of the different but complementary advantages of the two kinds of methods, it can be beneficial to use both methods together to accomplish the band selection task. Recently, a fast density-peak-based clustering (FDPC) algorithm has been proposed. Based on the computation of the local density and the intracluster distance of each point, the product of the two factors is sorted in decreasing order, and cluster centers are recognized as points with anomalously large values; hence, the FDPC algorithm can be considered a ranking-based clustering method. In this paper, the FDPC algorithm has been enhanced to make it suitable for hyperspectral band selection. First, the ranking score of each band is computed by weighting the normalized local density and the intracluster distance rather than equally taking them into account. Second, an exponential-based learning rule is employed to adjust the cutoff threshold for a different number of selected bands, where it is fixed in the FDPC. The proposed approach is thus named the enhanced FDPC (E-FDPC). Furthermore, an effective strategy, which is called the isolated-point-stopping criterion, is developed to automatically determine the appropriate number of bands to be selected. That is, the clustering process will be stopped by the emergence of an isolated point (the only point in one cluster). Experimental results on three real hyperspectral data demonstrate that the bands selected by our E-FDPC approach could achieve higher classification accuracy than the FDPC and other state-of-the-art band selection techniques, whereas the isolated-point-stopping criterion is a reasonable way to determine the preferable number of bands to be selected.",

        "abstract": "This paper analyzes and evaluates different MKL algorithms and their respective characteristics in different cases of HSI classification cases, and discusses the future direction and trends of research in this area. With the rapid development of spectral imaging techniques, classification of hyperspectral images (HSIs) has attracted great attention in various applications such as land survey and resource monitoring in the field of remote sensing. A key challenge in HSI classification is how to explore effective approaches to fully use the spatial\u2013spectral information provided by the data cube. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) has been successfully applied to HSI classification due to its capacity to handle heterogeneous fusion of both spectral and spatial features. This approach can generate an adaptive kernel as an optimally weighted sum of a few fixed kernels to model a nonlinear data structure. In this way, the difficulty of kernel selection and the limitation of a fixed kernel can be alleviated. Various MKL algorithms have been developed in recent years, such as the general MKL, the subspace MKL, the nonlinear MKL, the sparse MKL, and the ensemble MKL. The goal of this paper is to provide a systematic review of MKL methods, which have been applied to HSI classification. We also analyze and evaluate different MKL algorithms and their respective characteristics in different cases of HSI classification cases. Finally, we discuss the future direction and trends of research in this area.",

        "abstract": "A novel approach is presented, named splitfed learning (SFL), that amalgamates the two approaches eliminating their inherent drawbacks, along with a refined architectural configuration incorporating differential privacy and PixelDP to enhance data privacy and model robustness. Federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) are two popular distributed machine learning approaches. Both follow a model-to-data scenario; clients train and test machine learning models without sharing raw data. SL provides better model privacy than FL due to the machine learning model architecture split between clients and the server. Moreover, the split model makes SL a better option for resource-constrained environments. However, SL performs slower than FL due to the relay-based training across multiple clients. In this regard, this paper presents a novel approach, named splitfed learning (SFL), that amalgamates the two approaches eliminating their inherent drawbacks, along with a refined architectural configuration incorporating differential privacy and PixelDP to enhance data privacy and model robustness. Our analysis and empirical results demonstrate that (pure) SFL provides similar test accuracy and communication efficiency as SL while significantly decreasing its computation time per global epoch than in SL for multiple clients. Furthermore, as in SL, its communication efficiency over FL improves with the number of clients. Besides, the performance of SFL with privacy and robustness measures is further evaluated under extended experimental settings.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of retrieving video chunks by key-value query based on publish/subscribe model and proposes a hybrid of an asynchronous and synchronous communication mechanism for the Event-Based Microservice framework. The work presented in this paper proposes a novel approach to tracking a specific vehicle over the video streams published by the collaborating traffic surveillance cameras. In recent years, smart, effective transportation systems and intelligent traffic management applications are among the topics that have been given importance by various institutions. Developing a scalable, fault-tolerant, and resilient traffic monitoring system that retrieves video chunks with the desired query is challenging. For these challenging problems, stream processing and data retrieval systems have been developed over the years. However, there are still existing shortcomings between users and retrieval systems. This paper investigates the problem of retrieving video chunks by key-value query based on publish/subscribe model. Thus, we propose a hybrid of an asynchronous and synchronous communication mechanism for the Event-Based Microservice framework. We aim to develop generic techniques for better utilization of existing platforms. In the proposed framework, (i) first of all, microservices detect vehicles and extract their type, color, and speed features, and stored them in the metadata repository. (ii) Microservices publish each feature as events (iii) Other microservices self-join subscribe to those events, which leads to more events being published by combing all the possibilities: type-color, type-speed, color-speed, and type-color-speed. Finally, (iv) the system visualizes the query result and system status in real-time. When the user has selected color or/and a type or/and a speed feature, the system will return the best-matched vehicles without re-processing the videos. Experimental results show that our proposed system filters messages in real-time and supports easy integration of new microservices with the existing system.",

        "abstract": "An extension of a well-known workflow simulator WorkflowSim is proposed to implement an RL strategy for scheduling workflows, named ReASSIgN, which aims at learning the best scheduling based on previous executions in the absence of a mathematical model of the environment. Scientific experiments can be modeled as Workflows. Such Workflows are usually computing-and data-intensive, demanding the use of High-Performance Computing environments such as clusters, grids, and clouds. This latter offers the advantage of elasticity, which allows for increasing and/or decreasing the number of Virtual Machines (VMs) on demand. Workflows are typically managed using Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMS). Many existing SWfMSs offer support for cloud-based execution. Each SWfMS has its own scheduler that follows a well-defined cost function. However, such cost functions must consider the characteristics of a dynamic environment, such as live migrations and/or performance fluctuations, which are far from trivial to model. This paper proposes a novel scheduling strategy, named ReASSIgN, based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). By relying on an RL technique, one may assume that there is an optimal (or sub-optimal) solution for the scheduling problem, and aims at learning the best scheduling based on previous executions in the absence of a mathematical model of the environment. For this, an extension of a well-known workflow simulator WorkflowSim is proposed to implement an RL strategy for scheduling workflows. Once the scheduling plan is generated, the workflow is executed in the cloud using SciCumulus SWfMS. We conducted a thorough evaluation of the proposed scheduling strategy using a real astronomy workflow.",

This letter investigates the differentiated output-based privacy-preserving average consensus problem over digraphs. A new stochastic obfuscation algorithm is proposed to achieve better privacy-preserving effect. When the output messages for at least one out-neighbour are not leaked, the algorithm can be designed to achieve any pre-given consensus accuracy and privacy-preserving level simultaneously by properly selecting the private weights. Even if all the output messages are leaked, the algorithm can still ensure that each agent\u2019s initial state is protected to a certain extent. The mean square convergence of the algorithm is proved. The efficiency of the algorithm is verified by a numerical example.",

        "abstract": "Though adding a preprocessing step takes away some of the privacy budget from the actual classification process (thus potentially making it noisier and less accurate), it is shown that the novel preprocessing techniques significantly increase classifier accuracy on three real-world datasets. An important use of private data is to build machine learning classifiers. While there is a burgeoning literature on differentially private classification algorithms, we find that they are not practical in real applications due to two reasons. First, existing differentially private classifiers provide poor accuracy on real world datasets. Second, there is no known differentially private algorithm for empirically evaluating the private classifier on a private test dataset. \nIn this paper, we develop differentially private algorithms that mirror real world empirical machine learning workflows. We consider the private classifier training algorithm as a blackbox. We present private algorithms for selecting features that are input to the classifier. Though adding a preprocessing step takes away some of the privacy budget from the actual classification process (thus potentially making it noisier and less accurate), we show that our novel preprocessing techniques significantly increase classifier accuracy on three real-world datasets. We also present the first private algorithms for empirically constructing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves on a private test set.",

        "abstract": "Spark can outperform Hadoop by 10x in iterative machine learning jobs, and can be used to interactively query a 39 GB dataset with sub-second response time. MapReduce and its variants have been highly successful in implementing large-scale data-intensive applications on commodity clusters. However, most of these systems are built around an acyclic data flow model that is not suitable for other popular applications. This paper focuses on one such class of applications: those that reuse a working set of data across multiple parallel operations. This includes many iterative machine learning algorithms, as well as interactive data analysis tools. We propose a new framework called Spark that supports these applications while retaining the scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce. To achieve these goals, Spark introduces an abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across a set of machines that can be rebuilt if a partition is lost. Spark can outperform Hadoop by 10x in iterative machine learning jobs, and can be used to interactively query a 39 GB dataset with sub-second response time.",

We present an efficient method for detecting anomalies in videos. Recent applications of convolutional neural networks have shown promises of convolutional layers for object detection and recognition, especially in images. However, convolutional neural networks are supervised and require labels as learning signals. We propose a spatiotemporal architecture for anomaly detection in videos including crowded scenes. Our architecture includes two main components, one for spatial feature representation, and one for learning the temporal evolution of the spatial features. Experimental results on Avenue, Subway and UCSD benchmarks confirm that the detection accuracy of our method is comparable to state-of-the-art methods at a considerable speed of up to 140 fps.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a general framework that is agnostic to architecture and datasets and successfully embeds real images to the latent space of a high quality generative model, allowing it to perform image inpainting, merging, interpolation and online data augmentation. Generation of photo-realistic images, semantic editing and representation learning are a few of many potential applications of high resolution generative models. Recent progress in GANs have established them as an excellent choice for such tasks. However, since they do not provide an inference model, image editing or downstream tasks such as classification can not be done on real images using the GAN latent space. Despite numerous efforts to train an inference model or design an iterative method to invert a pre-trained generator, previous methods are dataset (e.g. human face images) and architecture (e.g. StyleGAN) specific. These methods are nontrivial to extend to novel datasets or architectures. We propose a general framework that is agnostic to architecture and datasets. Our key insight is that, by training the inference and the generative model together, we allow them to adapt to each other and to converge to a better quality model. Our InvGAN, short for Invertable GAN, successfully embeds real images to the latent space of a high quality generative model. This allows us to perform image inpainting, merging, interpolation and online data augmentation. We demonstrate this with extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments.",

        "abstract": "An improved multiscale superpixel-level constraint representation (MSPCR) is further proposed through the decision fusion process of SPCR at different scales, and the final category of the testing pixel is determined by the maximum number of the predicated labels among the classification results at each scale. Sparse representation (SR)-based models have been widely applied for hyperspectral image classification. In our previously established constraint representation (CR) model, we exploited the underlying significance of the sparse coefficient and proposed the participation degree (PD) to represent the contribution of the training sample in representing the testing pixel. However, the spatial variants of the original residual error-driven frameworks often suffer the obstacles to optimization due to the strong constraints. In this paper, based on the object-based image classification (OBIC) framework, we firstly propose a spectral\u2013spatial classification method, called superpixel-level constraint representation (SPCR). Firstly, it uses the PD in respect to the sparse coefficient from CR model. Then, transforming the individual PD to a united activity degree (UAD)-driven mechanism via a spatial constraint generated by the superpixel segmentation algorithm. The final classification is determined based on the UAD-driven mechanism. Considering that the SPCR is susceptible to the segmentation scale, an improved multiscale superpixel-level constraint representation (MSPCR) is further proposed through the decision fusion process of SPCR at different scales. The SPCR method is firstly performed at each scale, and the final category of the testing pixel is determined by the maximum number of the predicated labels among the classification results at each scale. Experimental results on four real hyperspectral datasets including a GF-5 satellite data verified the efficiency and practicability of the two proposed methods.",

Robust techniques such as sparse subspace clustering (SSC) have been recently developed for hyperspectral images (HSIs) based on the assumption that pixels belonging to the same land-cover class approximately lie in the same subspace. In order to account for the spatial information contained in HSIs, SSC models incorporating spatial information have become very popular. However, such models are often based on a local averaging constraint, which does not allow for a detailed exploration of the spatial information, thus limiting their discriminative capability and preventing the spatial homogeneity of the clustering results. To address these relevant issues, in this letter, we develop a new and effective \u21132-norm regularized SSC algorithm which adds a four-neighborhood \u21132-norm regularizer into the classical SSC model, thus taking full advantage of the spatial-spectral information contained in HSIs. The experimental results confirm the potential of including the spatial information (through the newly added \u21132-norm regularization term) in the SSC framework, which leads to a significant improvement in the clustering accuracy of SSC when applied to HSIs.",

        "abstract": "Hyperspectral images contain abundant spectral information, which provides great potential for detecting targets that cannot be analyzed with color images. However, a variety of factors, including inherent spectral variability and noise, make it difficult for traditional detectors to separate the target and background by using linear decision boundaries. In this work, we propose a nonlinear detector formulation by generalizing the conventional constrained energy minimization (CEM) method and then design novel nonlinear detectors with two deep neural network structures (named deep CEM or DCEM). The pixel-based structure confirms the effectiveness of the proposed framework, and the cube-based structure utilizing spatial information further improves the performance of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed DCEM method outperforms other competing hyperspectral target detection algorithms.",

        "abstract": "This paper uses a synthetic data set and three face databases to demonstrate that this method can achieve higher classification accuracy than SRC in cases of sparse sampling, nonlinear class manifolds, and stringent dimension reduction. Sparse representation-based classification (SRC), proposed by Wright et al., seeks the sparsest decomposition of a test sample over the dictionary of training samples, with classification to the most-contributing class. Because it assumes test samples can be written as linear combinations of their same-class training samples, the success of SRC depends on the size and representativeness of the training set. Our proposed classification algorithm enlarges the training set by using local principal component analysis to approximate the basis vectors of the tangent hyperplane of the class manifold at each training sample. The dictionary in SRC is replaced by a local dictionary that adapts to the test sample and includes training samples and their corresponding tangent basis vectors. We use a synthetic data set and three face databases to demonstrate that this method can achieve higher classification accuracy than SRC in cases of sparse sampling, nonlinear class manifolds, and stringent dimension reduction.",

Compressive sensing is an emerging field based on the rev elation that a small group of non-adaptive linear projections of a compressible signal contains enough information for reconstruction and processing. In this paper, we propose algorithms and hardware to support a new theory of compressive imaging. Our approach is based on a new digital image/video camera that directly acquires random projections of the signal without first collecting the pixels/voxels. Our camera architecture employs a digital micromirror array to perform optical calculations of linear projections of an image onto pseudorandom binary patterns. Its hallmarks include the ability to obtain an image with a single detection element while measuring the image/video fewer times than the number of pixels this can significantly reduce the computation required for video acquisition/encoding. Because our system relies on a single photon detector, it can also be adapted to image at wavelengths that are currently impossible with conventional CCD and CMOS imagers. We are currently testing a proto type design for the camera and include experimental results.",

        "abstract": "A new DR algorithm, which performs an unsupervised band selection technique following a clustering approach, is proposed, which achieved the best classification results in 60% of the experiments. A hyperspectral image provides fine details about the scene under analysis, due to its multiple bands. However, the resulting high dimensionality in the feature space may render a classification task unreliable, mainly due to overfitting and the Hughes phenomenon. In order to attenuate such problems, one can resort to dimensionality reduction (DR). Thus, this paper proposes a new DR algorithm, which performs an unsupervised band selection technique following a clustering approach. More specifically, the data set was split into a predefined number of clusters, after which the bands were iteratively selected based on the parameters of a separating hyperplane, which provided the best separation in the feature space, in a one-versus-all scenario. Then, a fine-tuning of the initially selected bands took place based on the separability of clusters. A comparison with five other state-of-the-art frameworks shows that the proposed method achieved the best classification results in 60% of the experiments.",

        "abstract": "A deep learning-based structure dictionary for HSI classification is proposed and extensive tests performed on hyperspectral dataset with bright prospects prove the developed method to be effective and outperform other existing methods. The construction of diverse dictionaries for sparse representation of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has been a hot topic over the past few years. However, compared with convolutional neural network (CNN) models, dictionary-based models cannot extract deeper spectral information, which will reduce their performance for HSI classification. Moreover, dictionary-based methods have low discriminative capability, which leads to less accurate classification. To solve the above problems, we propose a deep learning-based structure dictionary for HSI classification in this paper. The core ideas are threefold, as follows: (1) To extract the abundant spectral information, we incorporate deep residual neural networks in dictionary learning and represent input signals in the deep feature domain. (2) To enhance the discriminative ability of the proposed model, we optimize the structure of the dictionary and design sharing constraint in terms of sub-dictionaries. Thus, the general and specific feature of HSI samples can be learned separately. (3) To further enhance classification performance, we design two kinds of loss functions, including coding loss and discriminating loss. The coding loss is used to realize the group sparsity of code coefficients, in which within-class spectral samples can be represented intensively and effectively. The Fisher discriminating loss is used to enforce the sparse representation coefficients with large between-class scatter. Extensive tests performed on hyperspectral dataset with bright prospects prove the developed method to be effective and outperform other existing methods.",

        "abstract": "Experimental results show that the proposed method improves classification accuracy significantly and provides highly efficient results in the case of a small number of training samples. Abstract The classification of hyperspectral images is one of the most popular fields in remote sensing applications. It should be noted that spectral and spatial features have critical roles in this research area. This paper proposes a method based on spatial-spectral Schroedinger eigenmaps (SSSE) and multiple kernel learning (MKL) to classify hyperspectral images more efficiently while using a low number of training samples. In the proposed method, first SSSE is applied to spectral domain in order to extract significant features and reduce dimension of the original image. Then MKL is utilized to enhance the feature learning process and obtain an optimum combination of some specified kernels. Finally, the classification is carried out by substituting the optimal kernel in support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves classification accuracy significantly and provides highly efficient results in the case of a small number of training samples. Furthermore, the computation time of the proposed method is much lower than the state-of-the-art MKL methods.",

        "abstract": "This work is the first attempt to provide empirical comparisons of FL and SplitNN in real-world IoT settings in terms of learning performance and device implementation overhead and demonstrates that neither FL or SplitNN can be applied to a heavy model, e.g., with several million parameters, on resource-constrained IoT devices because its training cost would be too expensive for such devices. Federated learning (FL) and split neural networks (SplitNN) are state-of-art distributed machine learning techniques to enable machine learning without directly accessing raw data on clients or end devices. In theory, such distributed machine learning techniques have great potential in distributed applications, in which data are typically generated and collected at the client-side while the collected data should be processed by the application deployed at the server-side. However, there is still a significant gap in evaluating the performance of those techniques concerning their practicality in the Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled distributed systems constituted by resource-constrained devices. This work is the first attempt to provide empirical comparisons of FL and SplitNN in real-world IoT settings in terms of learning performance and device implementation overhead. We consider a variety of datasets, different model architectures, multiple clients, and various performance metrics. For the learning performance (i.e., model accuracy and convergence time), we empirically evaluate both FL and SplitNN under different types of data distributions such as imbalanced and non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. We show that the learning performance of SplitNN is better than FL under an imbalanced data distribution but worse than FL under an extreme non-IID data distribution. For implementation overhead, we mount both FL and SplitNN on Raspberry Pi devices and comprehensively evaluate their overhead, including training time, communication overhead, power consumption, and memory usage. Our key observations are that under the IoT scenario where the communication traffic is the primary concern, FL appears to perform better over SplitNN because FL has a significantly lower communication overhead compared with SplitNN. However, our experimental results also demonstrate that neither FL or SplitNN can be applied to a heavy model, e.g., with several million parameters, on resource-constrained IoT devices because its training cost would be too expensive for such devices.

        "abstract": "A holistic view of AI methods and capabilities in the context of edge computing comprises the well-known paradigms, such as predictive data analysis, machine learning, reasoning, and autonomous agents with learning and cognitive capabilities, which improves both fields in a variety of aspects. Edge computing, a key part of the upcoming 5G mobile networks and future 6G technologies, promises to distribute cloud applications while providing more bandwidth and reducing latencies [1]. The promises are delivered by moving application-specific computations between the cloud, the data producing devices, and the network infrastructure components at the edges of wireless and fixed networks. In stark contrast, current artificial intelligence (AI) and in particular machine learning (ML) methods assume computations are conducted in a homogeneous cloud with ample computational and data storage resources available. Currently, AI\u2019s cloud-centric architectural model requires transmitting data from the end-user devices to the cloud, consuming significant data transmission resources and introducing latencies. Previous studies address AI in different perspectives of IoT, edge computing and networks [2], [3], [4], [5]. However, we provide a holistic view of AI methods and capabilities in the context of edge computing. In our vision, a holistic view of AI methods for edge computing comprises the well-known paradigms, such as predictive data analysis, machine learning, reasoning, and autonomous agents with learning and cognitive capabilities. Further, the edge environment with its opportunistic nature, intermittent connectivity, and interplay of numerous stakeholders, presents a unique environment for deploying such applications based on computations units with different degrees of intelligence capabilities. Joint consideration of edge computing and AI methods, EdgeAI, improves both fields in a variety of aspects. We aim to identify the challenges and detail the potential benefits of AI at the edge, building a coherent and overarching vision of what distributed artificial intelligence means in the context of edge computing. Further, we aim to find the methods realizing those benefits, testing hypotheses in a real-world setting on the edge platform atop the 5G test network (http://5gtn.fi). Our vision will be realized within the 8-year span of the Academy of Finland 6Genesis Flagship.",

        "abstract": "This paper model the Apache Kafka topic partitioning process for a given topic, and proposes two simple, yet efficient heuristics to solve the problem, and demonstrates that they respect the hard constraints on replication latency and perform better w.r.t. unavailability time and OS load. Apache Kafka addresses the general problem of delivering extreme high volume event data to diverse consumers via a publish-subscribe messaging system. It uses partitions to scale a topic across many brokers for producers to write data in parallel, and also to facilitate parallel reading of consumers. Even though Apache Kafka provides some out of the box optimizations, it does not strictly define how each topic shall be efficiently distributed into partitions. The well-formulated fine-tuning that is needed in order to improve an Apache Kafka cluster performance is still an open research problem. In this paper, we first model the Apache Kafka topic partitioning process for a given topic. Then, given the set of brokers, constraints and application requirements on throughput, OS load, replication latency and unavailability, we formulate the optimization problem of finding how many partitions are needed and show that it is computationally intractable, being an integer program. Furthermore, we propose two simple, yet efficient heuristics to solve the problem: the first tries to minimize and the second to maximize the number of brokers used in the cluster. Finally, we evaluate its performance via largescale simulations, considering as benchmarks some Apache Kafka cluster configuration recommendations provided by Microsoft and Confluent. We demonstrate that, unlike the recommendations, the proposed heuristics respect the hard constraints on replication latency and perform better w.r.t. unavailability time and OS load, using the system resources in a more prudent way.",

        "abstract": "A novel scheduling strategy, named ReASSIgN, based on reinforcement learning (RL), is proposed, which aims at learning the best scheduling based on previous executions in the absence of a mathematical model of the environment. Most scientific experiments can be modeled as workflows. These workflows are usually computing\u2010 and data\u2010intensive, demanding the use of high\u2010performance computing environments such as clusters, grids, and clouds. This latter offers the advantage of the elasticity, which allows for changing the number of virtual machines (VMs) on demand. Workflows are typically managed using scientific workflow management systems (SWfMS). Many existing SWfMSs offer support for cloud\u2010based execution. Each SWfMS has its scheduler that follows a well\u2010defined cost function. However, such cost functions should consider the characteristics of a dynamic environment, such as live migrations or performance fluctuations, which are far from trivial to model. This article proposes a novel scheduling strategy, named ReASSIgN, based on reinforcement learning (RL). By relying on an RL technique, one may assume that there is an optimal (or suboptimal) solution for the scheduling problem, and aims at learning the best scheduling based on previous executions in the absence of a mathematical model of the environment. For this, an extension of a well\u2010known workflow simulator WorkflowSim is proposed to implement an RL strategy for scheduling workflows. Once the scheduling plan is generated via simulation, the workflow is executed in the cloud using SciCumulus SWfMS. We conducted a throughout evaluation of the proposed scheduling strategy using a real astronomy workflow named Montage.",

Average consensus is a widely used algorithm for distributed computing and control, where all the agents in the network constantly communicate and update their states in order to achieve an agreement. This approach could result in an undesirable disclosure of information on the initial state of agent i to the other agents. In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving average consensus algorithm to guarantee the privacy of the initial state and the convergence of the algorithm to the exact average of the initial values, by adding and subtracting random noises to the consensus process. We characterize the mean square convergence rate of our consensus algorithm and derive upper and lower bounds for the covariance matrix of the maximum likelihood estimate on the initial state.

Instance-based learning, and the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) in particular, provide simple yet effective classification algorithms for data mining. Classifiers are often executed on sensitive information such as medical or personal data. Differential privacy has recently emerged as the accepted standard for privacy protection in sensitive data. However, straightforward applications of differential privacy to k-NN classification yield rather inaccurate results. Motivated by this, we develop algorithms to increase the accuracy of private instance-based classification. We first describe the radius neighbors classifier (r-N) and show that its accuracy under differential privacy can be greatly improved by a non-trivial sensitivity analysis. Then, for k-NN classification, we build algorithms that convert k-NN classifiers to r-N classifiers. We experimentally evaluate the accuracy of both classifiers using various datasets. Experiments show that our proposed classifiers significantly outperform baseline private classifiers (i.e., straightforward applications of differential privacy) and executing the classifiers on a dataset published using differential privacy. In addition, the accuracy of our proposed k-NN classifiers are at least comparable to, and in many cases better than, the other differentially private machine learning techniques.",

        "abstract": "The proposed multiscale adaptive convolution adjusts the shape of the convolution kernel according to the spatial distribution of different superpixels in HSI, which helps to extract the complementary information of the HSI. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is widely used in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification owing to their advantages of spatial-spectral features capture capability and learning depth features as well as their structural flexibility. Nevertheless, the shape of the convolution kernel is fixed, a limitation that leads to shape fixation when modeling different features in CNN, especially in the edge regions between classes. A multiscale adaptive convolution (MSAC) model is proposed in this article to overcome this shortcoming. Combining superpixels with the traditional convolutional kernels to form adaptive kernels automatically adjusts the receptive field, suppresses edge noise, and enhances feature learning for different classes. On the basis of adaptive convolution, adaptive convolution units (AConvUs) are constructed. The hierarchical residual structure is constructed by superimposing multiple AConvUs to learn the spatial spectral features of different receptive fields of the HSI, reduce the gradient disappearance and enhance the robustness. The proposed multiscale convolution adjusts the shape of the convolution kernel according to the spatial distribution of different superpixels in HSI. Finally, the MSAC classification framework is constructed by the decision fusion of multiscale adaptive convolution at different superpixel scales, which helps to extract the complementary information of the HSI. The MSAC method\u2019s experimental performance on several HSI datasets, including Indian Pines, University of Pavia, Salinas and Gaofen-5, to verify the validity and practically.",

        "abstract": "A fast algorithm is proposed that obtains a sparse representation coefficient matrix by first selecting a small set of pixels that best represent their neighborhood, then performs spatial filtering to enforce the connectivity of neighboring pixels and uses fast spectral clustering to get the final clustering map. Accurate unsupervised classification of hyperspectral images (HSIs) is challenging and has drawn widespread attention in remote sensing due to its inherent complexity. Although significant efforts have been made to develop a variety of methods, most of them rely on supervised strategies. Subspace clustering methods, such as sparse subspace clustering (SSC), have become a popular tool for unsupervised learning due to their high performance. However, the computational complexity of SSC methods prevents their use on full HSIs. Furthermore, since SSC ignores the spatial information in the HSIs, its discrimination capability is limited, hampering the clustering results\u2019 spatial homogeneity. To address these two relevant issues, in this article, we propose a fast algorithm that obtains a sparse representation coefficient matrix by first selecting a small set of pixels that best represent their neighborhood. Then, it performs spatial filtering to enforce the connectivity of neighboring pixels and uses fast spectral clustering to get the final clustering map. Extensive simulations with our proposed method demonstrate its effectiveness in unsupervised HSI classification, obtaining remarkable high clustering performance compared with state-of-the-art SSC-based algorithms and even novel unsupervised-deep-learning-based methods. Besides, the proposed method is up to three orders of magnitude faster than SSC when clustering more than $\\text{2} \\times \\text{10}^4$ spectral pixels.",

        "abstract": "A global to local hierarchical detection algorithm for HSI (G2LHTD) and an adaptive neighborhood feature aggregation (ANFA) strategy, which will comprehensively evaluate the significance of neighborhood information in diverse directions. Hyperspectral image (HSI) has received considerable attention in the field of target detection due to its powerful ability to capture the spectral information of land covers, and plenty of detection algorithms have been explored. However, these methods generally leverage the difference between the spectrum of the target to be detected and the background spectrum to accomplish target detection, and so are susceptible to the problem of spectral variability. In this article, we propose a global to local hierarchical detection algorithm for HSI (G2LHTD). First, extended morphological attribute profile (EMAP) is first used to model global spatial texture information from HSI. Subsequently, a diverse-direction constrained energy minimization ( $\\text{D}^{2}$ CEM) detector is developed to consider the spatial information within eight neighborhoods around each pixel in HSI, yielding comprehensive local spatial information. More substantially, to effectively discriminate the neighborhood information in diverse directions, we devise an adaptive neighborhood feature aggregation (ANFA) strategy, which will comprehensively evaluate the significance of neighborhood information in diverse directions. As a result, the spatial features of HSI can be comprehensively considered for hyperspectral target detection (HTD). Extensive experiments, conducted on four standard datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The codes of this work will be available at https://github.com/zhonghaochen/G2LHTD_Master for the sake of reproducibility.",

        "abstract": "Due to the redundancy and sparsity of hyperspectral data, sparse representation (SR) has proven to be well-suited for hyperspectral band selection (BS). Moreover, graph regularizers can effectively incorporate local structural information of the data to improve the solution of SR. However, existing unsupervised BS approaches typically consider only a simple graph based on a single spectral metric. In contrast, the hypergraph can capture the multiple adjacencies of the bands and has significant advantages. This letter proposes a hypergraph-regularized self-representation (HyGSR) model for BS. HyGSR is innovative in that it jointly combines the spectral similarity and band index as a new similarity metric to rationalize the local structure of bands extracted by hypergraph, while using a robust $l_{2,1}$ -norm to exploit the sparse properties of the data for BS. Experimental results on four real hyperspectral scenarios verify that HyGSR outperforms other competitors with high stability and usability.",

        "abstract": "Experimental results indicate that the developed SR-DDL denoising method, can suppress image noises and subsequently enhance the image recognition performance. As an important method of biometric authentication, finger-vein recognition utilizes the unique finger-vein patterns to identify individuals at a high level of accuracy and safety. However, noise components, inherent in finger-vein images, pose a formidable challenge for extracting reliable finger-vein features for recognition. To tackle this challenge, intensive efforts have been directed at sparse representation (SR) methods, which can find the best representative of a test sample by a sparse linear combination of training samples (atoms) from a dictionary. Previous SR approaches treat training atoms equally for image representations, even if these atoms may vary in their effectiveness as feature descriptors, thus jeopardizing the denoising and recognition performances. To overcome this limitation, the present study proposed an adaptive SR with distance-based dictionary learning (DDL), enabling the ability to target more informative training samples. Specifically, based on the Euclidean distance, atoms in the dictionary are classified into two groups: the high-information and the low-information. Their weights for feature representations are assigned based on the distance entropy. Experimental results indicate that the developed SR-DDL denoising method, can suppress image noises and subsequently enhance the image recognition performance.",

        "abstract": "This work explores the idea of performing sparse image capture from a single image taken in one moment of time and measures a subset of the pixels in the photograph and uses compressed sensing algorithms to reconstruct the entire image from this data. Recently, there has been growing interest in using compressed sensing to perform imaging. Most of these algorithms capture the image of a scene by taking projections of the imaged scene with a large set of different random patterns. Unfortunately, these methods require thousands of serial measurements in order to reconstruct a high quality image, which makes them impractical for most real-world imaging applications. In this work, we explore the idea of performing sparse image capture from a single image taken in one moment of time. Our framework measures a subset of the pixels in the photograph and uses compressed sensing algorithms to reconstruct the entire image from this data. The benefit of our approach is that we can get a high-quality image while reducing the bandwidth of the imaging device because we only read a fraction of the pixels, not the entire array. Our approach can also be used to accurately fill in the missing pixel information for sensor arrays with defective pixels. We demonstrate better reconstructions of test images using our approach than with traditional reconstruction methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new supervised filter-based approach for band selection based on neural networks that yields the best results in 43.33% of the cases even with greatly reduced training data size, whereas the competitors have achieved between 13.33%) and 23.33%). ABSTRACT Hyperspectral images provide fine details of the scene under analysis in terms of spectral information. This is due to the presence of contiguous bands that make possible to distinguish different objects even when they have similar colour and shape. However, neighbouring bands are highly correlated, and, besides, the high dimensionality of hyperspectral images brings a heavy burden on processing and also may cause the Hughes phenomenon. It is therefore advisable to make a band selection pre-processing prior to the classification task. Thus, this paper proposes a new supervised filter-based approach for band selection based on neural networks. For each class of the data set, a binary single-layer neural network classifier performs a classification between that class and the remainder of the data. After that, the bands related to the biggest and smallest weights are selected, so, the band selection process is class-oriented. This process iterates until the previously defined number of bands is achieved. A comparison with three state-of-the-art band selection approaches shows that the proposed method yields the best results in 43.33% of the cases even with greatly reduced training data size, whereas the competitors have achieved between 13.33% and 23.33% on the Botswana, KSC and Indian Pines datasets.",

        "abstract": "Hyperspectral imagery (HSI) is an emerging remote sensing technology to discriminate different remote sensing objects. However, the HSI spatial resolution is relatively low due to the trade-off in restricted physical hardware and various imaging conditions, restricting the subsequent object detection applications. At present, the single hyperspectral super resolution (SHSR) strategy has encountered the bottleneck on more precise details extraction, and the fusion hyperspectral image super resolution (FHSR) strategy must need extra RGB/multispectral information, which is not suitable for general HSI usage. Also, both types of current strategies focus less on the multiple degradation causes of low spatial resolution. In this article, a step forward in designing a novel framework of multiple frame splicing strategy to greatly improve the SHSR quality, and applying multiple HSI degradation models to better fit the real degradation circumstance. Specifically, the framework is an end-to-end super resolution (SR) network that supersedes a single up-sampling module and removes complex attention residual model due to the same size of multiple splicing low-resolution input samples with high-resolution outputs. The effective framework will alleviate the vague at higher multiples, and accelerate the training convergence. Based on this framework, multiple degradation low-resolution samples can be simultaneously combined to fit better for the blind SR result. Concretely, the degradation focus on the blur, noise, compression, and their combinations to simulate the real degradation. Experimental results on three different hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed multiple frame splicing and degradation model (MFSDM) algorithm can significantly enhance the details in the recovered high-resolution hyperspectral images, and outperforms the state-of-the-art SHSR methods.",

        "abstract": "This work presents an approach to selecting the most informative and relevant spectral bands for HSI dimensionality reduction using the Krill Herd algorithm, a heuristic search method that seeks to reach the optimum global solution within the search space and effectively evade falling into the local optima. Abstract. Hyperspectral images (HSIs) have recently been exploited in several aspects as HSIs contain many contiguous and narrow discriminative spectral bands. The problem of dimensionality is a significant dilemma for HSIs due to there being plenty of irrelevant and redundant spectral bands and highly correlated bands that lead to Hughes phenomenon. To this end, we present an approach to selecting the most informative and relevant spectral bands for HSI dimensionality reduction using the Krill Herd (KH) algorithm. Moreover, KH is a heuristic search method that seeks to reach the optimum global solution within the search space and effectively evade falling into the local optima. Then an edge-preserving filter was employed to extract the spatial features while reducing noise and obtaining a suitable smoothing that improves the classification performance. Finally, the support vector machine classifier was performed at the pixel level for HSI classification. Furthermore, the proposed work was compared with the harmony search, genetic algorithm, bat algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and firefly algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated outstanding performance with an overall accuracy equal to 96.54%, 98.93%, 99.78%, and 98.66% on four hyperspectral datasets: Indian Pines scene, Pavia University scene, Salinas scene, and Botswana scene, respectively.",

        "abstract": "This work provides empirical comparisons of FL and SL in real-world IoT settings regarding (i) learning performance with heterogeneous data distributions and (ii) on-device execution overhead and proposes pragmatic techniques to substantially reduce the communication overhead. Federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) are state-of-the-art distributed machine learning techniques to enable machine learning training without accessing raw data on clients or end devices. However, their comparative training performance under real-world resource-restricted Internet of Things (IoT) device settings remains barely studied. This work provides empirical comparisons of FL and SL in real-world IoT settings regarding (i) learning performance with heterogeneous data distributions and (ii) on-device execution overhead. Our analyses in this work demonstrate that the learning performance of SL is better than FL under an imbalanced data distribution but worse than FL under an extreme non-IID data distribution. Recently, FL and SL are combined to form splitfed learning (SFL) to leverage each of their benefits (e.g., parallel training of FL and lightweight on-device computation requirement of SL). Our work considers FL, SL, and SFL, and mounts them on Raspberry Pi devices to evaluate their performance, including training time, communication overhead, power consumption, and memory usage with resource-restricted IoT devices. Besides evaluations, we apply two optimizations. First, we generalize SFL by carefully examining the possibility of a hybrid type of model training at the server-side. The generalized SFL merges sequential (dependent) and parallel (independent) processes of model training and thus is beneficial to a system with a large scale of IoT devices, specifically at the server-side operations. Second, we propose pragmatic techniques to substantially reduce the communication overhead by up to four times for the SL and (generalized) SFL.",

In recent years, there has been a massive increase in the amount of Internet of Things (IoT) devices as well as the data generated by such devices. The participating devices in IoT networks can be problematic due to their resource-constrained nature, and integrating security on these devices is often overlooked. This has resulted in attackers having an increased incentive to target IoT devices. As the number of attacks possible on a network increases, it becomes more difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) to cope with these attacks efficiently. In this paper, we highlight several machine learning (ML) methods such as k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and logistic regression (LR) that can be used in IDS. In this work, ML algorithms are compared for both binary and multi-class classification on Bot-IoT dataset. Based on several parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss, we experimentally compared the aforementioned ML algorithms. In the case of HTTP distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the accuracy of RF is 99%. Furthermore, other simulation results-based precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss metric reveal that RF outperforms on all types of attacks in binary classification. However, in multi-class classification, KNN outperforms other ML algorithms with an accuracy of 99%, which is 4% higher than RF.",

        "abstract": "A modular architecture is proposed to leverage innovative technologies for data acquisition, management and distribution, develop a multi-layer engineering solution for revealing valuable and hidden societal knowledge in smart cities environment, and tackle the main issues in tasks involving complex data flows and provide general guidelines to solve them. Smart city management is going through a remarkable transition, in terms of quality and diversity of services provided to the end-users. The stakeholders that deliver pervasive applications are now able to address fundamental challenges in the big data value chain, from data acquisition, data analysis and processing, data storage and curation, and data visualisation in real scenarios. Industry 4.0 is pushing this trend forward, demanding for servitization of products and data, also for the smart cities sector where humans, sensors and devices are operating in strict collaboration. The data produced by the ubiquitous devices must be processed quickly to allow the implementation of reactive services such as situational awareness, video surveillance and geo-localization, while always ensuring the safety and privacy of involved citizens. This paper proposes a modular architecture to (i) leverage innovative technologies for data acquisition, management and distribution (such as Apache Kafka and Apache NiFi), (ii) develop a multi-layer engineering solution for revealing valuable and hidden societal knowledge in smart cities environment, and (iii) tackle the main issues in tasks involving complex data flows and provide general guidelines to solve them. We derived some guidelines from an experimental setting performed together with leading industrial technical departments to accomplish an efficient system for monitoring and servitization of smart city assets, with a scalable platform that confirms its usefulness in numerous smart city use cases with different needs.",

        "abstract": "A deep-Q-network model in a multi-agent reinforcement learning setting to guide the scheduling of multi-workflows over infrastructure-as-a-service clouds and experimental results suggest that the proposed approach outperforms traditional ones, e.g., non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, multi-objective particle swarm optimization, and game-theoretic-based greedy algorithms, in terms of optimality of scheduling plans generated. Cloud Computing provides an effective platform for executing large-scale and complex workflow applications with a pay-as-you-go model. Nevertheless, various challenges, especially its optimal scheduling for multiple conflicting objectives, are yet to be addressed properly. The existing multi-objective workflow scheduling approaches are still limited in many ways, e.g., encoding is restricted by prior experts\u2019 knowledge when handling a dynamic real-time problem, which strongly influences the performance of scheduling. In this paper, we apply a deep-Q-network model in a multi-agent reinforcement learning setting to guide the scheduling of multi-workflows over infrastructure-as-a-service clouds. To optimize multi-workflow completion time and user\u2019s cost, we consider a Markov game model, which takes the number of workflow applications and heterogeneous virtual machines as state input and the maximum completion time and cost as rewards. The game model is capable of seeking for correlated equilibrium between make-span and cost criteria without prior experts\u2019 knowledge and converges to the correlated equilibrium policy in a dynamic real-time environment. To validate our proposed approach, we conduct extensive case studies based on multiple well-known scientific workflow templates and Amazon EC2 cloud. The experimental results clearly suggest that our proposed approach outperforms traditional ones, e.g., non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II, multi-objective particle swarm optimization, and game-theoretic-based greedy algorithms, in terms of optimality of scheduling plans generated.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a method for k-NN based outlier detection by separating the procedure into a fitting step on reference inlier data and then applying the outlier classifier to new data by partitioning the dataset into a uniform grid, which yields low global sensitivity. When applying outlier detection in settings where data is sensitive, mechanisms which guarantee the privacy of the underlying data are needed. The k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm is a simple and one of the most effective methods for outlier detection. So far, there have been no attempts made to develop a differentially private ( -DP) approach for k-NN based outlier detection. Existing approaches often relax the notion of -DP and employ other methods than k-NN. We propose a method for k-NN based outlier detection by separating the procedure into a fitting step on reference inlier data and then apply the outlier classifier to new data. We achieve -DP for both the fitting algorithm and the outlier classifier with respect to the reference data by partitioning the dataset into a uniform grid, which yields low global sensitivity. Our approach yields nearly optimal performance on real-world data with varying dimensions when compared to the non-private versions of k-NN.",

        "abstract": "An incremental query model for reference calculation is described, which is further embodied with three schemes (namely optimistic, sort-based and region-based) for different query patterns and leads to averagely 1.9X improvement in application throughput and reduction in pause time over the vanilla PS collector on CPU. Garbage collection (GC), especially full GC, would non- trivially impact overall application performance, especially for those memory-hungry ones handling large data sets. This paper presents an in-depth performance analysis on the full GC performance of Parallel Scavenge (PS), a state-of-the-art and the default garbage collector in the HotSpot JVM, using traditional and big-data applications running atop JVM on CPU (e.g., Intel Xeon) and many-integrated cores (e.g., Intel Xeon i). The analysis uncovers that unnecessary memory accesses and calculations during reference updating in the compaction ase are the main causes of lengthy full GC. To this end, this paper describes an incremental query model for reference calculation, which is further embodied with three schemes (namely optimistic, sort-based and region-based) for different query patterns. Performance evaluation shows that the incremental query model leads to averagely 1.9X (up to 2.9X) in full GC and 19.3% (up to 57.2%) improvement in application throughput, as well as 31.2% reduction in pause time over the vanilla PS collector on CPU, and the numbers are 2.1X (up to 3.4X), 11.1% (up to 41.2%) and 34.9% for Xeon i accordingly.",

In recent years, abnormal event detection in video surveillance has become a very important task mainly treated by deep learning methods taken into account many challenges. However, these methods still not trained on an anomaly detection based objective which proves their ineffectiveness in such a problem. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method based on a new architecture for deep one class of convolutional auto-encoders (CAEs) for representing a compact Spatio-temporal feature for anomaly detection. Our CAEs are constructed by added deconvolutions layers to the CNN VGG 16. Then, we train our CAEs for a one-class training objective by fine-tuning our model to properly exploit the richness of the dataset with which CNN was trained. The first CAE is trained on the original frames to extract a good descriptor of shapes and the second CAE is learned using optical flow representations to provide a strength description of motion between frames. For this purpose, we define two loss functions, compactness loss and representativeness loss for training our CAEs architectures not only to maximize the inter-classes distance and to minimize the intra-class distance but also to ensure the tightness and the representativeness of features of normal images. We reduce features dimensions by applying a PCA (Principal Component Analyser) to combine our two descriptors with a Gaussian classifier for abnormal Spatio-temporal events detection. Our method has a high performance in terms of reliability and accuracy. It achieved abnormal event detection with good efficiency in challenging datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Hyperspectral image classification is a prominent topic in many remote sensing applications, but the limited number of manually annotated samples leads to performance bottlenecks. To resolve this issue, a data augmentation and spatial-spectral residual framework is proposed for hyperspectral image classification using limited samples. Firstly, an unsupervised pseudo-sample generation method is proposed to augment the sample set, and the generalization capability of the model is improved by mixup operations. Then, to adequately extract the spatial-spectral features of hyperspectral images, a spatial-spectral residual framework is designed to improve the classification performance of the model. The qualitative and quantitative experiments were carried out on Indian Pines dataset to validate the effectiveness of the model.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, fast technological advancements have led to the development of high-quality software and hardware, revolutionizing various industries such as the economy, health, industry, and agriculture. Specifically, applying information and communication technology (ICT) tools and the Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture has improved productivity through sustainable food cultivation and environment preservation via efficient use of land and knowledge. However, limited access, high costs, and lack of training have created a considerable gap between farmers and ICT tools in some countries, e.g., Colombia. To address these challenges, we present AgroTIC, a smartphone-based application for agriculture that bridges the gap between farmers, agronomists, and merchants via ubiquitous technology and low-cost smartphones. AgroTIC enables farmers to monitor their crop health with the assistance of agronomists, image processing, and deep learning. Furthermore, when farmers are ready to market their agricultural products, AgroTIC provides a platform to connect them with merchants. We present a case study of the AgroTIC app among citrus fruit farmers from the Santander department in Colombia. Our study included over 200 farmers from more than 130 farms, and AgroTIC positively impacted their crop quality and production. The AgroTIC app was downloaded over 120 times during the study, and more than 170 farmers, agronomists, and merchants actively used the application.",

        "abstract": "A DL- based BS-HTD (DLBSTD) algorithm, incorporating DL-based BS withDL-based HTD for the first time, and a multidepth and multibranch network (MDBN) for HTD based on a novel BS method is proposed. Deep learning (DL) has recently risen to prominence in hyperspectral target detection (HTD). Nevertheless, how to tackle the extreme training sample imbalance together with achieving target highlighting and background suppression is challenging. In addition, due to the spectral redundancy of hyperspectral imagery (HSI), it is a new course for HTD through band selection (BS) to retain crucial bands, thereupon improving the subsequent detection performance. Accordingly, we propose a DL-based BS-HTD (DLBSTD) algorithm, incorporating DL-based BS with DL-based HTD for the first time. Most significantly, a multidepth and multibranch network (MDBN) for HTD based on a novel BS method is proposed. First, the BS method, including an alternating local\u2013global reconstruction network (ALGRN) and a correlation measurement strategy, provides representative bands containing key target information for MDBN. For the training sample imbalance of MDBN, we develop a BS-based method to select multifarious representative background training samples and propose a target band random substitution (TBRS) strategy to augment an ample target training set. Finally, the MDBN composed of a multidepth feature extraction (MDFE) module, three fusion strategies, and the parallel local convolution and gated recurrent unit (Conv-GRU) fully taps the spectral feature relationships to highlight targets and suppress backgrounds. Compared with nine competitive HTD algorithms, we carry out plentiful experiments on four classical datasets exhibiting that the proposed DLBSTD has strong generalization and salient detection performance of target highlighting and background suppression.",

        "abstract": "The experimental results validate the superiority of SOP-SRL in terms of performance and time when compared with other state-of-the-art band selection methods. For applications based on hyperspectral imagery (HSI), selecting informative and representative bands without the degradation of performance is a challenging task in the context of big data. In this paper, an unsupervised band selection method, scalable one-pass self-representation learning (SOP-SRL), is proposed to address this problem by processing data in a streaming fashion without storing the entire data. SOP-SRL embeds band selection into a scalable self-representation learning, which is formulated as an adaptive linear combination of regression-based loss functions, with the row-sparsity constraint. To further enhance the representativeness of bands, the local similarity between samples constructed by the selected bands is dynamically measured by means of graph-based regularization term in the embedded space. Moreover, a cache with memory function that reflects the quality of bands in the historical data is designed to keep the consistency between data coming at different times and guide subsequent band selection. An efficient algorithm is developed to optimize the SOP-SRL model. The HSI classification is conducted on three public data sets, and the experimental results validate the superiority of SOP-SRL in terms of performance and time when compared with other state-of-the-art band selection methods.",

Since the traditional Canny edge detection algorithm has the problem of being susceptible to noise interference, which makes the algorithm unable to accurately extract the edge information of an image in a noisy environment, in order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a Canny edge detection algorithm based on sparse representation denoising. In this paper, the sparse representation denoising method based on K-SVD replaces the Gaussian filtering in the traditional Canny operator, which can ensure that the edge information of the image is well preserved while removing the noise ; the gradient templates of horizontal, vertical, 45\u00b0and 135\u00b0directions in Sobel operator are used to calculate the image gradient value, which not only reduces the missed detection rate of edges, but also improves the anti-jamming performance of the algorithm; Otsu is used to overcome the issue of artificially set double thresholds and improve the adaptiveness and accuracy of edge detection of traditional algorithms. From the experimental results, it is found that the proposed algorithm can extract edge information from images with Gaussian noise more accurately and adaptively, which has obvious advantages compared with the traditional Canny algorithm.",

As a new approach to personal identification, finger-vein recognition is becoming an active topic in biometrics. And exploiting the underlying features related to finger-vein networks has been considered as a reliable way for finger-vein recognition. However, finger-vein network segmentation always is a difficult task due to the low contrast of finger-vein images. This paper focuses on finger-vein enhancement and segmentation based on Gabor filters in the spatial domain. Considering the high randomicity of the finger-vein networks, a bank of even-symmetric Gabor filters with eight orientations is firstly used to exploit vein information in images. Then, image reconstruction is implemented to generate an image containing an integrated finger-vein network. Finally, the finger-vein network is segmented using a proposed threshold image method. Experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of enhancing and segmenting finger-vein networks reliably and effectively.",

        "abstract": "A modified sensor concept is proposed which is able to acquire both a high spatial and a high temporal resolution by dynamically reading out only a subset of pixels in a non-regular order to obtain a highporal resolution. Both a high spatial and a high temporal resolution of images and videos are desirable in many applications, such as entertainment systems, monitoring manufacturing processes, or video surveillance. Due to the limited throughput of pixels per second, however, there is always a tradeoff between acquiring sequences with a high spatial resolution at a low temporal resolution or vice versa. In this paper, a modified sensor concept is proposed which is able to acquire both a high spatial and a high temporal resolution. This is achieved by dynamically reading out only a subset of pixels in a non-regular order to obtain a high temporal resolution. A full high spatial resolution is then obtained by performing a subsequent 3D reconstruction of the partially acquired frames. The main benefit of the proposed dynamic readout is that for each frame, different sampling points are available, which is advantageous since this information can significantly enhance the reconstruction quality of the proposed reconstruction algorithm. Using the proposed dynamic readout strategy, gains in the peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of up to 8.55 dB are achieved compared with a static readout strategy. Compared with the other state-of-the-art techniques, such as frame rate up-conversion or super-resolution, which are also able to reconstruct sequences with both a high spatial and a high temporal resolution, average gains in PSNR of up to 6.58 dB are possible.",

        "abstract": "The present result confirms that the high efficiency of the BS scheme is essentially important to observe and validate the Hughes\u2019 phenomenon in the analysis of HSI data, and shows that the classification accuracy can be affected by as much as approximately 10% when a single \u2018crucial\u2019 band is included or missed out for classification. Despite the numerous band selection (BS) algorithms reported in the field, most if not all have exhibited maximal accuracy when more spectral bands are utilized for classification. This apparently disagrees with the theoretical model of the \u2018curse of dimensionality\u2019 phenomenon, without apparent explanations. If it were true, then BS would be deemed as an academic piece of research without real benefits to practical applications. This paper presents a spatial spectral mutual information (SSMI) BS scheme that utilizes a spatial feature extraction technique as a preprocessing step, followed by the clustering of the mutual information (MI) of spectral bands for enhancing the efficiency of the BS. Through the SSMI BS scheme, a sharp \u2019bell\u2019-shaped accuracy-dimensionality characteristic that peaks at about 20 bands has been observed for the very first time. The performance of the proposed SSMI BS scheme has been validated through 6 hyperspectral imaging (HSI) datasets (Indian Pines, Botswana, Barrax, Pavia University, Salinas, and Kennedy Space Center (KSC)), and its classification accuracy is shown to be approximately 10% better than seven state-of-the-art BS schemes (Saliency, HyperBS, SLN, OCF, FDPC, ISSC, and Convolution Neural Network (CNN)). The present result confirms that the high efficiency of the BS scheme is essentially important to observe and validate the Hughes\u2019 phenomenon in the analysis of HSI data. Experiments also show that the classification accuracy can be affected by as much as approximately 10% when a single \u2018crucial\u2019 band is included or missed out for classification.",

        "abstract": "A bidirectional 3D quasi-recurrent neural network is designed that can be well generalized to remote sensing HSI datasets with limited number of training data and demonstrates improvements over state-of-the-art methods, in terms of both restoration accuracy and visual quality. Hyperspectral imaging is unable to acquire images with high resolution in both spatial and spectral dimensions yet, due to physical hardware limitations. It can only produce low spatial resolution images in most cases and thus hyperspectral image (HSI) spatial super-resolution is important. Recently, deep learning-based methods for HSI spatial super-resolution have been actively exploited. However, existing methods do not focus on structural spatial-spectral correlation and global correlation along spectra, which cannot fully exploit useful information for super-resolution. Also, some of the methods are straightforward extension of RGB super-resolution methods, which have fixed number of spectral channels and cannot be generally applied to hyperspectral images whose number of channels varies. Furthermore, unlike RGB images, existing HSI datasets are small and limit the performance of learning-based methods. In this article, we design a bidirectional 3D quasi-recurrent neural network for HSI super-resolution with arbitrary number of bands. Specifically, we introduce a core unit that contains a 3D convolutional module and a bidirectional quasi-recurrent pooling module to effectively extract structural spatial-spectral correlation and global correlation along spectra, respectively. By combining domain knowledge of HSI with a novel pretraining strategy, our method can be well generalized to remote sensing HSI datasets with limited number of training data. Extensive evaluations and comparisons on HSI super-resolution demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art methods, in terms of both restoration accuracy and visual quality.",

Split Learning (SL) is one promising variant of Federated Learning (FL), where the AI model is split and trained at the clients and the server collaboratively. By o\ufb04oading the computation-intensive portions to the server, SL enables e\ufb03cient model training on resource-constrained clients. Despite its booming applications, SL still lacks rigorous convergence analysis on non-IID data, which is critical for hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we \ufb01rst prove that SL exhibits an O (1 / \u221a R ) convergence rate for non-convex objectives on non-IID data, where R is the number of total training rounds. The derived convergence results can facilitate understanding the e\ufb00ect of some crucial factors in SL (e.g., data heterogeneity and synchronization interval). Furthermore, comparing with the convergence result of FL, we show that the guarantee of SL is worse than FL in terms of training rounds on non-IID data. The experimental results verify our theory. More \ufb01ndings on the comparison between FL and SL in cross-device settings are also reported.",

        "abstract": "This work introduces a novel intrusion detection approach based on an ensemble-based voting classifier that combines multiple traditional classifiers as a base learner and gives the vote to the predictions of the traditional classifier in order to get the final prediction. Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming human lives by paving the way for the management of physical devices on the edge. These interconnected IoT objects share data for remote accessibility and can be vulnerable to open attacks and illegal access. Intrusion detection methods are commonly used for the detection of such kinds of attacks but with these methods, the performance/accuracy is not optimal. This work introduces a novel intrusion detection approach based on an ensemble-based voting classifier that combines multiple traditional classifiers as a base learner and gives the vote to the predictions of the traditional classifier in order to get the final prediction. To test the effectiveness of the proposed approach, experiments are performed on a set of seven different IoT devices and tested for binary attack classification and multi-class attack classification. The results illustrate prominent accuracies on Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors and weather sensors to 96% and 97% and for other machine learning algorithms to 85% and 87%, respectively. Furthermore, comparison with other traditional machine learning methods validates the superiority of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the Age of Information (AoI) performance of the UAV-enabled wireless communication system consisting of two ground base stations under different parameters, such as the number of packets exchanged between theGround base stations, the distance between the ground station, the frequency that each ground station receives data packets and the SNR level. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) communications attracted significant research interest in recent years as a promising tool for future wireless communication systems (beyond fifth-generation (B5G)/sixth-generation (6G)) due to their numerous capabilities and broad applicability. In this paper we consider a UAV-enabled wireless communication system consisting of two ground base stations. Owing to distance, direct communication is not feasible for the ground stations. For this reason a UAV is used to travel periodically between the ground stations in order to enable communication. This communication model is widely used in single UAV architectures enabling throughput maximization and increased network security (especially in military applications). Since the performance of this communication system depends on several factors, in this paper we examine the Age of Information (AoI) performance of the system under different parameters, such as the number of packets exchanged between the ground base stations, the distance between the ground stations, the frequency that each ground station receives data packets and the SNR level since transmissions take place via an error-prone channel. Furthermore, we derive an analytical expression for the AoI considering the aforementioned parameters, and finally we provide simulation results that illustrate the impact of the network operating parameters on the age performance, considering the trade-off between the amount of data transferred through the network and the freshness of data exchanged between the terrestrial base stations.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an in-depth analysis promotes a broad vision for bringing Serverless to the Edge Computing and issues major challenges for serverless to be met before entering Edge computing. Born from a need for a pure \u201cpay-per-use\u201d model and highly scalable platform, the \u201cServerless\u201d paradigm emerged and has the potential to become a dominant way of building cloud applications. Although it was originally designed for cloud environments, Serverless is finding its position in the Edge Computing landscape, aiming to bring computational resources closer to the data source. That is, Serverless is crossing cloud borders to assess its merits in Edge computing, whose principal partner will be the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. This move sounds promising as Serverless brings particular benefits such as eliminating always-on services causing high electricity usage, for instance. However, the community is still hesitant to uptake Serverless Edge Computing because of the cloud-driven design of current Serverless platforms, and distinctive characteristics of edge landscape and IoT applications. In this paper, we evaluate both sides to shed light on the Serverless new territory. Our in-depth analysis promotes a broad vision for bringing Serverless to the Edge Computing. It also issues major challenges for Serverless to be met before entering Edge computing.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the data-driven optimal synchronization problem for complex networks (CNs) with unknown dynamics by using pre-compensation technology, and proposes a novel data- driven control scheme, composed of parts: compensator, controller and critic network. This paper studies the data-driven optimal synchronization problem for complex networks (CNs) with unknown dynamics. By using pre-compensation technology, a compensator and a controller are proposed. Then, an augmented error system is constructed, which can circumvent the requirement of system dynamics. It is revealed that the the optimal synchronization control of CNs works as the optimal regulation of the augmented system with a performance function. A novel policy iteration (PI) algorithm is given to ensure that the iterative performance function can converge to the optimal value which is the solution of the coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation (HJB), which means that the optimal regulation of the augmented system can be solved and the synchronization can be achieved. Based on this, a novel data-driven control scheme is proposed, which is composed of parts: compensator, controller and critic network. The iterative performance is generated by critic network. The compensator is used to construct the control parameter by using performance and the controller is used to construct control input by using control parameter. Both compensator and critic network are implemented by neural networks (NNs) and only depend on the process sampling data. Finally, we use robot network as an example to verify the effectiveness of proposed control scheme.",

In cyber-physical systems sensors data should be anonymized at the source. Local data perturbation with differential privacy guarantees can be used, but the resulting utility is often (too) low. In this paper we contribute an algorithm that combines local, differentially private data perturbation of sensor streams with highly accurate outlier detection.

        "abstract": "This work evaluated the usage of a technique - Garbage Collector Control Interceptor (GCI) - that eliminates the negative impact of GC on performance by controlling GC executions and transparently shedding requests while the collections are happening. Runtime environments like Java's JRE, .NET's CLR, and Ruby's MRI, are popular choices for cloud-based applications and particularly in the Function as a Service (FaaS) serverless computing context. A critical component of runtime environments of these languages is the garbage collector (GC). The GC frees developers from manual memory management, which could potentially ease development and avoid bugs. The benefits of using the GC come with a negative impact on performance; that impact happens because either the GC needs to pause the runtime execution or competes with the running program for computational resources. In this work, we evaluated the usage of a technique - Garbage Collector Control Interceptor (GCI) - that eliminates the negative impact of GC on performance by controlling GC executions and transparently shedding requests while the collections are happening. We executed experiments simulating AWS Lambda's behavior and found that GCI is a viable solution. It benefited the user by improving the response time up to 10.86% at 99.9th percentile and reducing cost by 7.22%, but it also helped the platform provider by improving resource utilization by 14.52%.",

Perceiving meaningful activities in a long video sequence is a challenging problem due to ambiguous definition of 'meaningfulness' as well as clutters in the scene. We approach this problem by learning a generative model for regular motion patterns (termed as regularity) using multiple sources with very limited supervision. Specifically, we propose two methods that are built upon the autoencoders for their ability to work with little to no supervision. We first leverage the conventional handcrafted spatio-temporal local features and learn a fully connected autoencoder on them. Second, we build a fully convolutional feed-forward autoencoder to learn both the local features and the classifiers as an end-to-end learning framework. Our model can capture the regularities from multiple datasets. We evaluate our methods in both qualitative and quantitative ways - showing the learned regularity of videos in various aspects and demonstrating competitive performance on anomaly detection datasets as an application.",

        "abstract": "FocusFace, a multi-task architecture that uses contrastive learning to be able to accurately perform masked face recognition, is proposed and it is shown that when using the method on top of already existing methods the training computational costs decrease significantly while retaining similar performances. SARS-CoV-2 has presented direct and indirect challenges to the scientific community. One of the most prominent indirect challenges advents from the mandatory use of face masks in a large number of countries. Face recognition methods struggle to perform identity verification with similar accuracy on masked and unmasked individuals. It has been shown that the performance of these methods drops considerably in the presence of face masks, especially if the reference image is unmasked. We propose FocusFace, a multi-task architecture that uses contrastive learning to be able to accurately perform masked face recognition. The proposed architecture is designed to be trained from scratch or to work on top of state-of-the-art face recognition methods without sacrificing the capabilities of a existing models in conventional face recognition tasks. We also explore different approaches to design the contrastive learning module. Results are presented in terms of masked-masked (M-M) and unmasked-masked (U-M) face verification performance. For both settings, the results are on par with published methods, but for M-M specifically, the proposed method was able to outperform all the solutions that it was compared to. We further show that when using our method on top of already existing methods the training computational costs decrease significantly while retaining similar performances. The implementation and the trained models are available at GitHub.",

        "abstract": "A cross-modality feature learning framework, called common subspace learning (CoSpace), is proposed, by jointly considering sub space learning and supervised classification, to achieve accurate land cover classification over a large coverage. With a large amount of open satellite multispectral (MS) imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8), considerable attention has been paid to global MS land cover classification. However, its limited spectral information hinders further improving the classification performance. Hyperspectral imaging enables discrimination between spectrally similar classes but its swath width from space is narrow compared to MS ones. To achieve accurate land cover classification over a large coverage, we propose a cross-modality feature learning framework, called common subspace learning (CoSpace), by jointly considering subspace learning and supervised classification. By locally aligning the manifold structure of the two modalities, CoSpace linearly learns a shared latent subspace from hyperspectral-MS (HS-MS) correspondences. The MS out-of-samples can be then projected into the subspace, which are expected to take advantages of rich spectral information of the corresponding hyperspectral data used for learning, and thus leads to a better classification. Extensive experiments on two simulated HS-MS data sets (University of Houston and Chikusei), where HS-MS data sets have tradeoffs between coverage and spectral resolution, are performed to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with previous state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "The proposed target detection method through tree-structured encoding (TD-TSE) for HSIs is proposed, which is not constrained by any model assumptions, which makes it highly practical for the hyperspectral data in real scenes. Target detection aims to locate targets of interest within a specific scene. The traditional model-driven detectors based on signal processing have proved to be very effective. However, the detection performance of such traditional methods relies heavily on the model assumption, which is limited by the discrepancy with real hyperspectral images (HSIs) data. In this article, a target detection method through tree-structured encoding (TD-TSE) for HSIs is proposed. Instead of modeling the target and the background to extract valid features, we construct a binary tree based on the features of the data itself and segment the HSI to improve the separability of the target and the background. For the purpose of highlighting the target and suppressing the background, a novel measurement of separation, distance on tree, is calculated via binary encoding based on the constructed tree structure, and the detection output can be obtained according to such distance. To further reduce the generalization error resulting from random subsampling, the statistical average of the distances on multiple independent trees is estimated to improve the robustness of TD-TSE. The proposed method is not constrained by any model assumptions, which is fundamentally different from the most widely used hyperspectral target detectors in the field of signal processing. Moreover, the construction of binary trees without any labeled samples and the linear complexity of the proposed method make it highly practical for the hyperspectral data in real scenes. Extensive experiments on three benchmark HSI data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TD-TSE for hyperspectral target detection.",

        "abstract": "A semisupervised band selection with an optimal graph (BSOG) approach, which performs BS and local structure learning simultaneously, and an efficient and simple optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this model. Semisupervised band selection (BS) technique plays an important role in processing hyperspectral images (HSIs) because of its superiority of using the limited labeled data and plentiful unlabeled data to select the discriminative and informative feature, which copes with the problem of high-dimensional and scare labeled samples of HSIs. Among semisupervised BS models, graph-based methods are superior to others in many situations and have received more and more attention. However, traditional graph-based models construct a similarity matrix and select valuable bands independently. The similarity matrix remains constant, which will damage the local manifold structure and lead to a suboptimal result. To solve this problem, we propose a semisupervised band selection with an optimal graph (BSOG) approach, which performs BS and local structure learning simultaneously. Instead of fixing the input similarity matrix, the similarity matrix is updated constantly to learn a better local structure. Besides, the learned similarity matrix is adaptive. Then, the optimal band subset can be selected by analyzing the obtained projection matrix $\\boldsymbol W$ . An efficient and simple optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this model. Experiments on four real HSIs data validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

During post-processing, we also applied certain approaches to improve the clarity of the retrieved finger vein pattern. Morphological Operations are employed during post-processing to expand the vein pattern\u2019s shape and structure.

        "abstract": "Quarter sampling is a novel sensor design that allows for an acquisition of higher resolution images without increasing the number of pixels. When being used for video data, one out of four pixels is measured in each frame. Effectively, this leads to a non-regular spatio-temporal sub-sampling. Compared to purely spatial or temporal sub-sampling, this allows for an increased reconstruction quality, as aliasing artifacts can be reduced. For the fast reconstruction of such sensor data with a fixed mask, recursive variant of frequency selective reconstruction (FSR) was proposed. Here, pixels measured in previous frames are projected into the current frame to support its reconstruction. In doing so, the motion between the frames is computed using template matching. Since some of the motion vectors may be erroneous, it is important to perform a proper consistency checking. In this paper, we propose faster consistency checking methods as well as a novel recursive FSR that uses the projected pixels different than in literature and can handle dynamic masks. Altogether, we are able to significantly increase the reconstruction quality by + 1.01 dB compared to the state-of-the-art recursive reconstruction method using a fixed mask. Compared to a single frame reconstruction, an average gain of about + 1.52 dB is achieved for dynamic masks. At the same time, the computational complexity of the consistency checks is reduced by a factor of 13 compared to the literature algorithm.",

        "abstract": "A general classification approach based on the shape of spectral signatures is presented, in contrast to classical classification approaches, where not only reflectance values are considered, but also parameters such as curvature points, curvature values, and the curvature behavior of spectral signature are used. Due to its high spatial and spectral information content, hyperspectral imaging opens up new possibilities for a better understanding of data and scenes in a wide variety of applications. An essential part of this process of understanding is the classification part. In this article we present a general classification approach based on the shape of spectral signatures. In contrast to classical classification approaches (e.g. SVM, KNN), not only reflectance values are considered, but also parameters such as curvature points, curvature values, and the curvature behavior of spectral signatures are used to develop shape-describing rules in order to use them for classification by a rule-based procedure using IF-THEN queries. The flexibility and efficiency of the methodology is demonstrated using datasets from two different application fields and leads to convincing results with good performance.",

        "abstract": "A novel single HS image SR approach is proposed based on a spatial correlation-regularized unmixing convolutional neural network (CNN), which takes advantage of a CNN to explore the collaborative spatial and spectral information of an HS image and infer the high-resolution abundance maps, thereby reconstructing the anticipated high- resolution HS image via the linear spectral mixture model. Super-resolution (SR) technology has emerged as an effective tool for image analysis and interpretation. However, single hyperspectral (HS) image SR remains challenging, due to the high spectral dimensionality and lack of available high-resolution information of auxiliary sources. To fully exploit the spectral and spatial characteristics, in this paper, a novel single HS image SR approach is proposed based on a spatial correlation-regularized unmixing convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed approach takes advantage of a CNN to explore the collaborative spatial and spectral information of an HS image and infer the high-resolution abundance maps, thereby reconstructing the anticipated high-resolution HS image via the linear spectral mixture model. Moreover, a dual-branch architecture network and spatial spread transform function are employed to characterize the spatial correlation between the high- and low-resolution HS images, aiming at promoting the fidelity of the super-resolved image. Experiments on three public remote sensing HS images demonstrate the feasibility and superiority in terms of spectral fidelity, compared with some state-of-the-art HS image super-resolution methods.",

        "abstract": "A hybrid feature selection strategy based on the simulated annealing genetic algorithm (SAGA) and the Choquet fuzzy integral (CFI) that can achieve higher classification accuracy than traditional methods is proposed. Hyperspectral remote sensing technology is a rapidly developing new integrated technology that is widely used in numerous areas. Rich spectral information from hyperspectral images can aid in the classification and recognition of the ground objects. However, the high dimensions of hyperspectral images cause redundancy in information. Hence, the high dimensions of hyperspectral data must be reduced. This paper proposes a hybrid feature selection strategy based on the simulated annealing genetic algorithm (SAGA) and the Choquet fuzzy integral (CFI). The band selection method is proposed from subspace decomposition, which combines the simulated annealing algorithm with the genetic algorithm in choosing different cross-over and mutation probabilities, as well as mutation individuals. Then, the selecting bands are further refined by CFI. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve higher classification accuracy than traditional methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper analyzes the convergence of Federated Averaging on non-iid data and establishes a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{T})$ for strongly convex and smooth problems, where $T$ is the number of SGDs. Federated learning enables a large amount of edge computing devices to jointly learn a model without data sharing. As a leading algorithm in this setting, Federated Averaging (\\texttt{FedAvg}) runs Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in parallel on a small subset of the total devices and averages the sequences only once in a while. Despite its simplicity, it lacks theoretical guarantees under realistic settings. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of \\texttt{FedAvg} on non-iid data and establish a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{T})$ for strongly convex and smooth problems, where $T$ is the number of SGDs. Importantly, our bound demonstrates a trade-off between communication-efficiency and convergence rate. As user devices may be disconnected from the server, we relax the assumption of full device participation to partial device participation and study different averaging schemes; low device participation rate can be achieved without severely slowing down the learning. Our results indicate that heterogeneity of data slows down the convergence, which matches empirical observations. Furthermore, we provide a necessary condition for \\texttt{FedAvg} on non-iid data: the learning rate $\\eta$ must decay, even if full-gradient is used; otherwise, the solution will be $\\Omega (\\eta)$ away from the optimal.",

Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) are indispensable defensive tools against various cyberattacks. Lightweight, multipurpose, and anomaly-based detection NIDSs employ several methods to build profiles for normal and malicious behaviors. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate the performance of machine-learning-based NIDS in IoT networks. Specifically, we study six supervised learning methods that belong to three different classes: (1) ensemble methods, (2) neural network methods, and (3) kernel methods. To evaluate the developed NIDSs, we use the distilled-Kitsune-2018 and NSL-KDD datasets, both consisting of a contemporary real-world IoT network traffic subjected to different network attacks. Standard performance evaluation metrics from the machine-learning literature are used to evaluate the identification accuracy, error rates, and inference speed. Our empirical analysis indicates that ensemble methods provide better accuracy and lower error rates compared with neural network and kernel methods. On the other hand, neural network methods provide the highest inference speed which proves their suitability for high-bandwidth networks. We also provide a comparison with state-of-the-art solutions and show that our best results are better than any prior art by 1~20%.",

        "abstract": "This paper surveys the work done toward all of the outstanding issues, relating to this new class of networks, so as to spur further research in these areas. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have enormous potential in the public and civil domains. These are particularly useful in applications, where human lives would otherwise be endangered. Multi-UAV systems can collaboratively complete missions more efficiently and economically as compared to single UAV systems. However, there are many issues to be resolved before effective use of UAVs can be made to provide stable and reliable context-specific networks. Much of the work carried out in the areas of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) does not address the unique characteristics of the UAV networks. UAV networks may vary from slow dynamic to dynamic and have intermittent links and fluid topology. While it is believed that ad hoc mesh network would be most suitable for UAV networks yet the architecture of multi-UAV networks has been an understudied area. Software defined networking (SDN) could facilitate flexible deployment and management of new services and help reduce cost, increase security and availability in networks. Routing demands of UAV networks go beyond the needs of MANETS and VANETS. Protocols are required that would adapt to high mobility, dynamic topology, intermittent links, power constraints, and changing link quality. UAVs may fail and the network may get partitioned making delay and disruption tolerance an important design consideration. Limited life of the node and dynamicity of the network lead to the requirement of seamless handovers, where researchers are looking at the work done in the areas of MANETs and VANETs, but the jury is still out. As energy supply on UAVs is limited, protocols in various layers should contribute toward greening of the network. This paper surveys the work done toward all of these outstanding issues, relating to this new class of networks, so as to spur further research in these areas.",

        "abstract": "The reference architecture for the SCF is introduced and it is shown how it unlocks the full potential of the Edge-Cloud continuum and main opportunities and challenges need to be overcome in order to achieve the vision of the Serverless Computing Fabric. Serverless computing has been establishing itself as a compelling paradigm for the development and of modern cloud-native applications. Serverless represents the next step in the evolution of cloud programming models, services and platforms, which is especially appealing due to its low management overhead, easy deployment, scale-to-zero and the promise of optimized costs. Recently, due to the advantages it offers, the serverless paradigm has been growing beyond traditional clouds, making its way to the Edge. The natural evolutionary step for serverless computing is to unify the Edge and the Cloud into what we refer to as Edge-Cloud Continuum. In this paper, we outline our vision of the Serverless Computing Fabric (SCF) for the Edge-Cloud continuum. We introduce the reference architecture for the SCF and show how it unlocks the full potential of the Edge-Cloud continuum. We also discuss main opportunities and challenges, which need to be overcome in order to achieve the vision of the Serverless Computing Fabric. Finally, we introduce key design principles together with core enabling runtime mechanisms, which are intended to serve as a research road map towards the Serverless Computing Fabric for Edge-Cloud continuum.",

        "abstract": "This study focuses on reducing the execution cost of workflow applications mainly caused by task computation and data transmission, while satisfying the workflow deadline in uncertain edge-cloud environments with a costdriven fuzzy scheduling strategy based on an Adaptive Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (ADPSO). Workflow scheduling is critical to performing many practical workflow applications. Scheduling based on edgecloud computing can help addressing the high complexity of workflow applications, while decreasing the data transmission delay. However, due to the nature of heterogeneous resources in edge-cloud environments and the complicated data dependencies between the tasks in such a workflow, significant challenges for workflow scheduling remain, including the selection of an optimal tasks-servers solution from the possible numerous combinations. Existing studies are mainly done subject to rigorous conditions without fluctuations, ignoring the fact that workflow scheduling is typically present in uncertain environments. In this study, we focus on reducing the execution cost of workflow applications mainly caused by task computation and data transmission, while satisfying the workflow deadline in uncertain edge-cloud environments. The Triangular Fuzzy Numbers (TFNs) are adopted to represent task processing time and data transferring time. A costdriven fuzzy scheduling strategy based on an Adaptive Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (ADPSO) algorithm is proposed, which is employed the operators of Genetic Algorithm (GA). This strategy introduces the randomly two-point crossover operator, neighborhood mutation operator, and adaptive multipoint mutation operator of GA to effectively avoid converging on local optima. The experimental results show that our strategy can effectively reduce the workflow execution cost in uncertain edgecloud environments, compared with other benchmark solutions.

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel off-policy iterative algorithm is developed, which only uses the measurement data along the trajectory of the system to deal with the optimal control problem of the discrete-time complex dynamic networks. By approximating the solutions of the coupled Hamilton\u2013Jacobi\u2013Bellman equations, a local performance index is defined to solve the optimal synchronization problem for discrete-time nonlinear complex dynamic networks without knowing the node dynamics and the topology of the directed graph. Based on this, an off-policy iteration algorithm is designed to iteratively improve the target policy, and the convergence of the algorithm is proved theoretically. Actor-critic neural networks along with the gradient descent approach are employed to approximate optimal control policies and performance index functions using the data generated by applying prescribed behavior policies. Finally, two numerical simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

The increasing societal demand for data privacy has led researchers to develop methods to preserve privacy in data analysis. However, outlier analysis, a fundamental data analytics task with critical applications in medicine, finance, and national security, has only been analyzed for a few specialized cases of data privacy. This work is the first to provide a general framework for private outlier analysis, which is a two-step process. First, we show how to identify the relevant problem-specifications and then provide a practical solution that formally meets these specifications.",

In the paper Controlling Garbage Collection and Request Admission to Improve Performance of FaaS Applications[30], we verified and evaluated the impact of memory management mechanics of programming languages in the context of Functions as a Service (FaaS) via simulation experiments. The results of this study pointed to an impact of up to 11.68% on the response time of requests when a garbage collector procedure was executed during the execution of a CPU-bound function. As future work, we listed a few threats to the validity of the results attained, and among them, we cited the validation of the simulation model used. The validation of the model is important because it validates the results generated in the simulation experiments, which ensures realistic results. In this work, we proposed and executed a validation to the simulation model used in the previous work. To do so, we run measurement experiments in a public FaaS platform and simulation experiments of the same scenarios using the same simulator of the previous paper. Then, we validate the simulator by comparing the results obtained in both experiments to ensure that the simulation result and the measurement one are equivalent.

Blockchains or distributed ledgers are an emerging technology that has drawn considerable interest from energy supply firms, startups, technology developers, financial institutions, national governments and the academic community. Numerous sources coming from these backgrounds identify blockchains as having the potential to bring significant benefits and innovation. Blockchains promise transparent, tamper-proof, and secure systems that can enable novel business solutions, especially when combined with smart contracts. This work provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental principles that underpin blockchain technologies, such as system architectures and distributed consensus algorithms. Since Blockchain technology has repeatedly proven its importance in various fields, now the advantages of technology have become obvious in large energy companies. Many developed countries are massively starting to introduce Blockchain technology into the energy industry. While it is mainly pilot projects or just technology testing but already now Blockchain can qualify for creating new energy markets. The energy sector is currently at the stage of transition from a centralized system to a decentralized one in which complete autonomy will be achieved through the production and storage of energy.",

        "abstract": "The results presented from the systematic analysis highlight that real-world energy blockchains are growing exponentially year-on-year, producing relatively low failure/drop-off rates, and demonstrating information sharing protocols that produce content with insufficient technical and theoretical depth. The application of blockchain technology to the energy sector promises to derive new operating models focused on local generation and sustainable practices, which are driven by peer-to-peer collaboration and community engagement. However, real-world energy blockchains differ from typical blockchain networks insofar as they must interoperate with grid infrastructure, adhere to energy regulations, and embody engineering principles. Naturally, these additional dimensions make real-world energy blockchains highly dependent on the participation of grid operators, engineers, and energy providers. Although much theoretical and proof-of-concept research has been published on energy blockchains, this research aims to establish a lens on real-world projects and implementations that may inform the alignment of academic and industry research agendas. This research classifies 131 real-world energy blockchain initiatives to develop an understanding of how blockchains are being applied to the energy domain, what type of failure rates can be observed from recently reported initiatives, and what level of technical and theoretical details are reported for real-world deployments. The results presented from the systematic analysis highlight that real-world energy blockchains are (a) growing exponentially year-on-year, (b) producing relatively low failure/drop-off rates (~7% since 2015), and (c) demonstrating information sharing protocols that produce content with insufficient technical and theoretical depth.",

        "abstract": "Novel approaches for learning motion features and modelling normal spatio-temporal dynamics for anomaly detection using deep convolutional neural networks and a sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder for prediction and reconstruction are presented. Anomaly detection is an area of video analysis that has great importance in automated surveillance. Although it has been extensively studied, there has been little work on using deep convolutional neural networks to learn spatio-temporal feature representations. In this thesis we present novel approaches for learning motion features and modelling normal spatio-temporal dynamics for anomaly detection. The contributions are divided into two main chapters. The \ufb01rst introduces a method that uses a convolutional autoencoder to learn motion features from foreground optical \ufb02ow patches. The autoencoder is coupled with a spatial sparsity constraint, known as Winner-Take-All, to learn shift-invariant and generic \ufb02ow-features. This method solves the problem of using hand-crafted feature representations in state of the art methods. Moreover, to capture variations in scale of the patterns of motion as an object moves in depth through the scene,we also divide the image plane into regions and learn a separate normality model in each region. We compare the methods with state of the art approaches on two datasets and demonstrate improved performance. \nThe second main chapter presents a end-to-end method that learns normal spatio-temporal dynamics from video volumes using a sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder for prediction and reconstruction. This work is based on the intuition that the encoder-decoder learns to estimate normal sequences in a training set with low error, thus it estimates an abnormal sequence with high error. Error between the network's output and the target is used to classify a video volume as normal or abnormal. In addition to the use of reconstruction error, we also use prediction error for anomaly detection. \nWe evaluate the second method on three datasets. The prediction models show comparable performance with state of the art methods. In comparison with the \ufb01rst proposed method, performance is improved in one dataset. Moreover, running time is signi\ufb01cantly faster.",

        "abstract": "Sustainable the interoperable deployability of MFR methods on OFR datasets, when the occlusions are of a reasonable size, so that solutions proposed for MFR can be effectively deployed for general OFR. Over the years, the evolution of face recognition (FR) algorithms has been steep and accelerated by a myriad of factors. Motivated by the unexpected elements found in real-world scenarios, researchers have investigated and developed a number of methods for occluded face recognition (OFR). However, due to the SarS-Cov2 pandemic, masked face recognition (MFR) research branched from OFR and became a hot and urgent research challenge. Due to time and data constraints, these models followed different and novel approaches to handle lower face occlusions, i.e., face masks. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the different approaches followed for both MFR and OFR, find linked details about the two conceptually similar research directions and understand future directions for both topics. For this analysis, several occluded and face recognition algorithms from the literature are studied. First, they are evaluated in the task that they were trained on, but also on the other. These methods were picked accordingly to the novelty of their approach, proven state-of-the-art results, and publicly available source code. We present quantitative results on 4 occluded and 5 masked FR datasets, and a qualitative analysis of several MFR and OFR models on the Occ-LFW dataset. The analysis presented, sustain the interoperable deployability of MFR methods on OFR datasets, when the occlusions are of a reasonable size. Thus, solutions proposed for MFR can be effectively deployed for general OFR.",

Extensive attention has been widely paid to enhance the spatial resolution of hyperspectral (HS) images with the aid of multispectral (MS) images in remote sensing. However, the ability in the fusion of HS and MS images remains to be improved, particularly in large-scale scenes, due to the limited acquisition of HS images. Alternatively, we super-resolve MS images in the spectral domain by the means of partially overlapped HS images, yielding a novel and promising topic: spectral superresolution (SSR) of MS imagery. This is challenging and less investigated task due to its high ill-posedness in inverse imaging. To this end, we develop a simple but effective method, called joint sparse and low-rank learning (J-SLoL), to spectrally enhance MS images by jointly learning low-rank HS\u2013MS dictionary pairs from overlapped regions. J-SLoL infers and recovers the unknown HS signals over a larger coverage by sparse coding on the learned dictionary pair. Furthermore, we validate the SSR performance on three HS\u2013MS data sets (two for classification and one for unmixing) in terms of reconstruction, classification, and unmixing by comparing with several existing state-of-the-art baselines, showing the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed J-SLoL algorithm. Furthermore, the codes and data sets will be available at https://github.com/danfenghong/IEEE_TGRS_J-SLoL, contributing to the remote sensing (RS) community.",

These activities must be performed in suitable manner and most importantly at appropriate time in order to get good yield. But sadly most of the farmers are unaware about the impact of these activities on yield of their crop. So application is developed to educate farmers about it. The developed software application is basically for dissemination of information to farmers about the proper way of performing various farming activities in regional language Punjabi, of two main crops of Punjabwheat and paddy. This application will assists farmers in performing these activities in proper manner and help them in improving their productivity of crops. Based on date of sowing, farmers will get notifications about farming activities. Additional advice will be provided along with the notification on the basis of weather conditions. This system is an android based application developed in regional language Punjabi for overcoming lingual barrier of farmers. The application is developed using Android Studio which is the official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing an Android application.",

        "abstract": "Without any prior information, hyperspectral anomaly detection is devoted to locating targets of interest within a specific scene by exploiting differences in spectral characteristics between various land covers. Traditional methods originated from the signal processing perspective, and most of them rely heavily on specific model assumptions. Because of the model-driven attributes, such methods cannot mine the deep-level features of data to adapt to the variability of scenes and cannot fully extract the information of land covers contained in images to accurately separate anomalies from the background. By independently designing a chessboard-shaped topological framework that avoids making any distribution assumptions but directly mines high-dimensional data features to break through the limitations of traditional detectors, this article proposes a novel chessboard topology-based anomaly detection (CTAD) method to dissect images and extract detailed information of land covers adaptively, thereby enabling highly accurate detection. Extensive experimental results on hyperspectral images (HSIs) in real scenes demonstrate that the proposed CTAD can be adapted to the variability of scenes by autonomously learning data features and exhibiting strong generalization and detection capabilities, facilitating practical applications.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a graph learning based autoencoder (GLAE) to achieve unsupervised hyperspectral band selection using the relationships of pair-wise pixels within HSIs, and intoduce an alternative optimization algorithm. Hyperspectral band selection aims to identify an optimal sub-set of bands from hyperspectral images (HSIs). Most existing methods explore the relationships between pair-wise pixels in a fixed graph. However, the quality of the initial fixed graph may be influenced by noises and user-defined parameters that may not be optimal for HSI analysis. In this paper, we pro-pose a graph learning based autoencoder (GLAE) to achieve unsupervised hyperspectral band selection. Using the relationships of pair-wise pixels within HSIs, GLAE constructs the initial graph to characterize the geometric structures of HSIs and then adjusts the graph to adapt the band selection process. To solve the proposed model, we intoduce an alternative optimization algorithm. Experiments and comparisons on three HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed GLAE achieves better results over the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Both Repeated Line Tracking, Gabor Filter and Multilinear discriminant analysis are efficient method for feature extraction but, combination of these two techniques with MDA Classifier increases the performance and average accuracy as compare to existing systems. Finger vein detection is a physiological characteristics-based biometric technique, and it uses vein patterns of human finger to perform identity authentication. Even in the case of identical twins the finger-vein patterns are believed to be quite unique [1]. Moreover finger vein has many more advantages as compare to other biometric system as result its application area becoming wider day by day. In this paper, following techniques are analyzed i.e., Repeated Line Tracking, Gabor Filter and Multilinear discriminant analysis (MDA). Both Repeated Line Tracking, Gabor Filter are efficient method for feature extraction but, combination of these two techniques with MDA Classifier increases the performance and average accuracy as compare to existing systems. In proposed work some important parameters like Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR),MSE,Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR) and False Acceptance Rate (FAR) are calculated for Performance evaluation. When tested on a finger vein images database this system provides more accurate results and it is less time consuming as compared with existing.",

        "abstract": "This work presents an iterative algorithm to improve an arbitrary quarter sampling mask which results in a continuous increase of the reconstruction quality and tests two simple algorithms, namely, linear interpolation and nearest neighbor interpolation, as well as two more sophisticated algorithms, such as steering kernel regression and frequency selective extrapolation. Non-regular sampling can reduce aliasing at the expense of noise. Recently, it has been shown that non-regular sampling can be carried out using a conventional regular imaging sensor when the surface of its individual pixels is partially covered. This technique is called quarter sampling (also 1/4 sampling), since only one quarter of each pixel is sensitive to light. For this purpose, the choice of a proper sampling mask is crucial to achieve a high reconstruction quality. In the scope of this work, we present an iterative algorithm to improve an arbitrary quarter sampling mask which results in a continuous increase of the reconstruction quality. In terms of the reconstruction algorithms, we test two simple algorithms, namely, linear interpolation and nearest neighbor interpolation, as well as two more sophisticated algorithms, namely, steering kernel regression and frequency selective extrapolation. Besides PSNR gains of +0.31 dB to +0.68 dB relative to a random quarter sampling mask resulting from our optimized mask, visually noticeable enhancements are perceptible.",

        "abstract": "The presented classification method quantifies the spectral curve shape and takes full use of the spectral shape differences among land covers to classify remotely sensed images and is helpful for classification research on hyperspectral and multi-temporal images. Land-cover datasets are crucial for earth system modeling and human-nature interaction research at local, regional and global scales. They can be obtained from remotely sensed data using image classification methods. However, in processes of image classification, spectral values have received considerable attention for most classification methods, while the spectral curve shape has seldom been used because it is difficult to be quantified. This study presents a classification method based on the observation that the spectral curve is composed of segments and certain extreme values. The presented classification method quantifies the spectral curve shape and takes full use of the spectral shape differences among land covers to classify remotely sensed images. Using this method, classification maps from TM (Thematic mapper) data were obtained with an overall accuracy of 0.834 and 0.854 for two respective test areas. The approach presented in this paper, which differs from previous image classification methods that were mostly concerned with spectral \u201cvalue\u201d similarity characteristics, emphasizes the \"shape\" similarity characteristics of the spectral curve. Moreover, this study will be helpful for classification research on hyperspectral and multi-temporal images.",

        "abstract": "Experimental results demonstrate that the LSE-SFIM based on bilinear (LES- SFIM-B) performs significantly better than the traditional SFIM algorithm and other spatially enhanced LSE -SFIM algorithms proposed in this paper, while the computing time is much shorter. The fusion of a hyperspectral image (HSI) and multispectral image (MSI) can significantly improve the ability of ground target recognition and identification. The quality of spatial information and the fidelity of spectral information are normally contradictory. However, these two properties are non-negligible indicators for multi-source remote-sensing images fusion. The smoothing filter-based intensity modulation (SFIM) method is a simple yet effective model for image fusion, which can improve the spatial texture details of the image well, and maintain the spectral characteristics of the image significantly. However, traditional SFIM has a poor effect for edge information sharpening, leading to a bad overall fusion result. In order to obtain better spatial information, a spatial filter-based improved LSE-SFIM algorithm is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the least square estimation (LSE) algorithm is combined with SFIM, which can effectively improve the spatial information quality of the fused image. At the same time, in order to better maintain the spatial information, four spatial filters (mean, median, nearest and bilinear) are used for the simulated MSI image to extract fine spatial information. Six quality indexes are used to compare the performance of different algorithms, and the experimental results demonstrate that the LSE-SFIM based on bilinear (LES-SFIM-B) performs significantly better than the traditional SFIM algorithm and other spatially enhanced LSE-SFIM algorithms proposed in this paper. Furthermore, LSE-SFIM-B could also obtain similar performance compared with three state-of-the-art HSI-MSI fusion algorithms (CNMF, HySure, and FUSE), while the computing time is much shorter.",

        "abstract": "Experimental results reveal that compared with the dimensionality reduction method, which only uses information entropy or Bhattacharyya distance as the evaluation criterion, the proposed method achieves global optimum more easily, and then obtains a better band combination and possess higher classification accuracy. Information entropy and interclass separability are adopted as the evaluation criteria of dimension reduction for hyperspectral remote sensor data. However, it is rather single-faceted to simply use either information entropy or interclass separability as evaluation criteria, and will lead to a single-target problem. In this case, the chosen optimal band combination may be unfavorable for the improvement of follow-up classification accuracy. Thus, in this work, inter-band correlation is considered as the premise, and information entropy and interclass separability are synthesized as the evaluation criterion of dimension reduction. The multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is easy to implement and characterized by rapid convergence. It is adopted to search for the optimal band combination. In addition, game theory is also introduced to dimension reduction to coordinate potential conflicts when both information entropy and interclass separability are used to search for the optimal band combination. Experimental results reveal that compared with the dimensionality reduction method, which only uses information entropy or Bhattacharyya distance as the evaluation criterion, and the method combining multiple criterions into one by weighting, the proposed method achieves global optimum more easily, and then obtains a better band combination and possess higher classification accuracy.",

        "abstract": "This paper first explicitly characterize the behavior of the FedAvg algorithm, and shows that without strong and unrealistic assumptions on the problem structure, the algorithm can behave erratically for non-convex problems (e.g., diverge to infinity). Federated Learning (FL) has become a popular paradigm for learning from distributed data. To effectively utilize data at different devices without moving them to the cloud, algorithms such as the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) have adopted a \"computation then aggregation\" (CTA) model, in which multiple local updates are performed using local data, before sending the local models to the cloud for aggregation. \nHowever, these schemes typically require strong assumptions, such as the local data are identically independent distributed (i.i.d), or the size of the local gradients are bounded. In this paper, we first explicitly characterize the behavior of the FedAvg algorithm, and show that without strong and unrealistic assumptions on the problem structure, the algorithm can behave erratically for non-convex problems (e.g., diverge to infinity). Aiming at designing FL algorithms that are provably fast and require as few assumptions as possible, we propose a new algorithm design strategy from the primal-dual optimization perspective. Our strategy yields a family of algorithms that take the same CTA model as existing algorithms, but they can deal with the non-convex objective, achieve the best possible optimization and communication complexity while being able to deal with both the full batch and mini-batch local computation models. Most importantly, the proposed algorithms are {\\it communication efficient}, in the sense that the communication pattern can be adaptive to the level of heterogeneity among the local data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithmic framework for FL that achieves all the above properties.",

        "abstract": "An ensemble learning model for botnet attack detection in IoT networks called ELBA-IoT that profiles behavior features of IoT networks and uses ensemble learning to identify anomalous network traffic from compromised IoT devices is proposed. Due to the prompt expansion and development of intelligent systems and autonomous, energy-aware sensing devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) has remarkably grown and obstructed nearly all applications in our daily life. However, constraints in computation, storage, and communication capabilities of IoT devices has led to an increase in IoT-based botnet attacks. To mitigate this threat, there is a need for a lightweight and anomaly-based detection system that can build profiles for normal and malicious activities over IoT networks. In this paper, we propose an ensemble learning model for botnet attack detection in IoT networks called ELBA-IoT that profiles behavior features of IoT networks and uses ensemble learning to identify anomalous network traffic from compromised IoT devices. In addition, our IoT-based botnet detection approach characterizes the evaluation of three different machine learning techniques that belong to decision tree techniques (AdaBoosted, RUSBoosted, and bagged). To evaluate ELBA-IoT, we used the N-BaIoT-2021 dataset, which comprises records of both normal IoT network traffic and botnet attack traffic of infected IoT devices. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed ELBA-IoT can detect the botnet attacks launched from the compromised IoT devices with high detection accuracy (99.6%) and low inference overhead (40 \u00b5-seconds). We also contrast ELBA-IoT results with other state-of-the-art results and demonstrate that ELBA-IoT is superior.",

The unmanned aerial vehicle communication networks (UAVCN) comprises of a collection of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to build a network that can be used for many applications. These nodes autonomously fly in free space in ad-hoc mode to carry out the mission. However, the UAVs face some challenging issues during collaboration and communication. These nodes have high speed, hence the communication links fail to route the traffic that affects the routing mechanism. Therefore, UAVCN communication affecting the quality of service and facing the performance issue. Power is another major problem to limit and optimize the use of power, the energy-efficient mechanism is needed.

The serverless paradigm has been rapidly adopted by developers of cloud-native applications, mainly because it relieves them from the burden of provisioning, scaling, and operating the underlying infrastructure. In this chapter, we propose a novel computing paradigm\u2014Deviceless Edge Computing\u2014 that extends the serverless paradigm to the edge of the network, enabling IoT and Edge devices, such as gateways and micro clouds, to be seamlessly integrated as application execution infrastructure. We propose a reference architecture for the Deviceless Edge Computing. We also analyze the main requirements and challenges to realize this novel computing paradigm from two main points of view: (1) required support for application development, in terms of programming models, and (2) required runtime support for deviceless applications, in terms of main deviceless platform mechanisms. Finally, we show how our existing work in the area of Edge Computing and IoT serves as starting point and as one of main enablers for realizing the emerging Deviceless Edge Computing.",

        "abstract": "This paper develops an off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to solve optimal synchronization of multiagent systems by using the framework of graphical games and shows that the optimal distributed policies found by the proposed algorithm satisfy the global Nash equilibrium and synchronize all agents to the leader. This paper develops an off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to solve optimal synchronization of multiagent systems. This is accomplished by using the framework of graphical games. In contrast to traditional control protocols, which require complete knowledge of agent dynamics, the proposed off-policy RL algorithm is a model-free approach, in that it solves the optimal synchronization problem without knowing any knowledge of the agent dynamics. A prescribed control policy, called behavior policy, is applied to each agent to generate and collect data for learning. An off-policy Bellman equation is derived for each agent to learn the value function for the policy under evaluation, called target policy, and find an improved policy, simultaneously. Actor and critic neural networks along with least-square approach are employed to approximate target control policies and value functions using the data generated by applying prescribed behavior policies. Finally, an off-policy RL algorithm is presented that is implemented in real time and gives the approximate optimal control policy for each agent using only measured data. It is shown that the optimal distributed policies found by the proposed algorithm satisfy the global Nash equilibrium and synchronize all agents to the leader. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "This paper defines privacy in the context of collaborative outlier detection and develops a novel method to find outliers from horizontally partitioned categorical data in a privacy-preserving manner that provides an end-to-end privacy guarantee by using the differential privacy model and secure multiparty computation techniques. Collaborative analytics is crucial to extract value from data collected by different organizations and stored in separate silos. However, privacy and legal concerns often inhibit the integration and joint analysis of data. One of the most important data analytics tasks is that of outlier detection, which aims to find abnormal entities that are significantly different from the remaining data. In this paper, we define privacy in the context of collaborative outlier detection and develop a novel method to find outliers from horizontally partitioned categorical data in a privacy-preserving manner. Our method is based on a scalable outlier detection technique that uses attribute value frequencies. We provide an end-to-end privacy guarantee by using the differential privacy model and secure multiparty computation techniques. Experiments on real data show that our proposed technique is both effective and efficient.",

        "abstract": "An analysis of the existing applications of this new technology in the world electric sector is presented, with the main applications being the sale of electric energy in Smart Grids, Distributed Generation, Electric Vehicles and Smart home. In the last few years, due to the ongoing knowledge revolution, the electric sector is also inserted in a process of technological transformations, without precedents, in the world scenario. These transformations are triggered by the solid and gradual insertion of distributed energy resources, from the generation of electric energy from renewable sources and with the advancement of information and communication technologies. The structural changes motivated by the transformations of the electric sector open space for the use of new technologies that can promote the transition to more decarbonized, decentralized and reliable energy systems, accelerating the digitalization. One example is blockchain technology. The blockchain is a digital structure that can contain digital transactions, data records and executables. The main objective of blockchain technology is to remove the need for intermediaries and replace them with a distributed network of digital users who work in partnership to verify transactions and ensure record integrity. This paper will analyze the impacts of blockchain technology on the electricity sector, investigating the challenges and opportunities of these applications. The analysis of projects applied physically on blockchain in the electric sector worldwide is also covered in this article. The study will be conducted based on systematic reviews of the literature and the expected results are the discussion of the research found, investigating the challenges and opportunities of blockchain technology in the electricity sector, in order to assess its impact on the new energy system's configuration. In addition, an analysis of the existing applications of this new technology in the world electric sector is presented, with the main applications being the sale of electric energy in Smart Grids, Distributed Generation, Electric Vehicles and Smart home.",

In this paper, we propose a novel method for video anomaly detection motivated by an existing architecture for sequence-to-sequence prediction and reconstruction using a spatio-temporal convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (convLSTM). As in previous work on anomaly detection, anomalies arise as spatially localised failures in reconstruction or prediction. In experiments with five benchmark datasets, we show that using prediction gives superior performance to using reconstruction. We also compare performance with different length input/output sequences. Overall, our results using prediction are comparable with the state of the art on the benchmark datasets.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in mask-wearing, which poses a challenge for face recognition systems. The proposed model uses Pareto optimization to balance accuracy and computation time, and data preprocessing techniques to address the issue of masked faces. The evaluation results demonstrate that the model achieves high accuracy on both masked and unmasked faces, outperforming existing models in the literature. The \ufb01ndings of this study have implications for improving the performance of face recognition systems in real-world scenarios where mask-wearing is prevalent. The results of this study show that the Pareto optimization allowed improving the overall accuracy over the 94% achieved by the original FaceNet variant, which also performed similarly to the ArcFace model during testing. Furthermore, a Pareto-optimized model no longer has a limitation of the model size and is much smaller and more ef\ufb01cient version than the original FaceNet and derivatives, helping to reduce its inference time and making it more practical for use in real-life applications.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes to learn locality-constrained sparse coding (LCSC) for short, on partially overlapped hyperspectral (HS)-MS pairs (i.e., dictionary) to enhance the spectral resolution of MS imagery, enabling the identification of materials at a more precise level by the means of richer spectral information. Owing to easy acquisition and large coverage from the space, multispectral (MS) imaging has garnered growing interest in various applications of remote sensing. However, the limited spectral information of MS data, to a great extent, leads to difficulties in classifying the materials more accurately, particularly for those classes that have very similar visual appearances. To address this issue effectively, we attempt to enhance the spectral resolution of MS imagery, enabling the identification of materials at a more precise level by the means of richer spectral information. More specifically, we propose to learn locality-constrained sparse coding (LCSC) for short, on partially overlapped hyperspectral (HS)-MS pairs (i.e., dictionary). LCSC is capable of capturing neighboring relations well by enforcing the local constraint for each pixel. Such a strategy makes it possible to better reconstruct HS products from MS images and partially overlapped HS images. Reconstruction and unmixing are explored as potential applications to assess the performance of spectral enhancement. Extensive experiments are conducted on two HS-MS data sets in comparison with several state-of-the-art baselines, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LCSC algorithm in the task of spectral enhancement.",

        "abstract": "Shrimp farming is a technology-driven and risk-intensive food production system. Shrimp farms are remotely located and farmers need customized farm advisories, which the conventional extension systems are not able to provide. To provide technology advisories to the stakeholders, an android mobile application, CIBA ShrimpApp, was developed in 2018, based on the information and format requirements of the shrimp farmers using Java language as front end and the data bases were created as back end through Structured Query Language (MySQL). The app contains eight modules, viz. better management practices of shrimp farming, quantification of inputs, on-farm disease diagnosis, on-farm risk assessment, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) in shrimp farming, regulations, advisories and updates and posting queries which were integrated as a mobile application. The app has more than 27,500 cumulative downloads and has a rating of 4.5 out of 5.0. The application was found to have improved the knowledge level of end users to the tune of 20\u201337%. The Google firebase application data showed that 98.4% of users of CIBA ShrimpApp were free from errors and crashes. An evaluation study conducted among sample regular users indicated that the app aided in farm decision-making and its design functionality and extension service function were perceived to be efficient. Considering the all-pervading mobile phone connectivity and affordability, smart phone-based mobile applications and data analytics can play a significant role in shrimp farm advisory services and its sustainability.",

        "abstract": "Hyperspectral target detection is a crucial application that encompasses military, environmental, and civil needs. Target detection algorithms that have prior knowledge often assume a fixed laboratory target spectrum, which can differ significantly from the test image in the scene. This discrepancy can be attributed to various factors such as atmospheric conditions and sensor internal effects, resulting in decreased detection accuracy. To address this challenge, this article introduces a novel method for detecting hyperspectral image (HSI) targets with certain spatial information, referred to as the semantic transferred priori for hyperspectral target detection with spatial\u2013spectral association (SSAD). Considering that the spatial textures of the HSI remain relatively constant compared to the spectral features, we propose to extract a unique and precise target spectrum from each image data via target detection in its spatial domain. Specifically, employing transfer learning, we designed a semantic segmentation network adapted for HSIs to discriminate the spatial areas of targets and then aggregated a customized target spectrum with those spectral pixels localized. With the extracted target spectrum, spectral dimensional target detection is performed subsequently by the constrained energy minimization (CEM) detector. The final detection results are obtained by combining an attention generator module to aggregate target features and deep stacked feature fusion (DSFF) module to hierarchically reduce the false alarm rate. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves higher detection accuracy and superior visual performance compared to the other benchmark methods.",

        "title": "Development of finger vein identification system using feature combination and dimensionality reduction",
        "abstract": "The feature combination of DWT and LBP was proved to perform better than the finger vein identification system that involved only single type of feature by average of 6.91% improvement. With the increase in globalization and living standard, finger vein biometric trait becomes a popular focus in the human recognition and security system. Finger vein is high security as it is hard to be stolen or duplicate since it hides underneath the finger skin. Image quality and contrast is the main problem that was faced by researcher in the finger vein identification system. It may cause by the wrong posture, light intensity and image rotation during the image captured session. Previous works had stated that the wavelet-based features are invariant to image rotation while local binary based features robust against high saturation and irregular shading. However, the feature combination of these two different features type has not been studied yet in finger vein identification system. Besides that, the dimensionality reduction technique such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was frequently involved in finger vein recognition system in this recent year. Generally, PCA was used to remove the noise residing in the discarded dimension. However, the features reduction in earlier stage using PCA may remove the important features as PCA might remove the local information where it concludes that the information for the corresponding eigenvalue is noise. Therefore, this research proposed to develop a finger vein identification using combination features of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP). The combined features were then undergoing dimensionality reduction using PCA and LDA. The finger vein image firstly undergoes image pre-processing to enhance the image quality, followed by region of interest (ROI) extraction and noise removal using median filtering. The pre-processed finger vein images will go through feature extraction using DWT and LBP to get the features in vectors form and then combined. The process was continued by applying PCA or LDA on the combination features. Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Fine K-Nearest Neighbours (FKNN) were used for classification in this research. At the same time, the conventional finger vein identification system was designed with Repeated Line Tracking (RLT) and Maximum Curvature (MAXC) as feature extraction methods followed by Speeded-up Robust Features (SURF) as the classification method. The performance of the proposed system was compared with the conventional finger vein identification system using same database which is known as SDMULA-HMT. Throughout the experiments, the feature combination of DWT and LBP was proved to perform better than the finger vein identification system that involved only single type of feature by average of 6.91% improvement. At the early stage, the proposed system achieved 80.16% identification rate, which is a bit lower than the conventional system. However, when the proposed system and the conventional system are applied with dimensionality reduction using PCA and LDA, the identification rate increased dramatically in proposed system while there was only small improvement on the conventional finger vein identification system. The proposed system achieved the highest identification rate at 100% when the feature is performed using LDA at feature dimension of 30.",

        "abstract": "Using the quarter sampling sensor, the image quality in terms of PSNR can be increased by + 0.67 dB for the Urban 100 dataset compared to using a low-resolution sensor with VDSR. Quarter sampling is a novel sensor concept that enables the acquisition of higher resolution images without increasing the number of pixels. This is achieved by covering three quarters of each pixel of a low-resolution sensor such that only one quadrant of the sensor area of each pixel is sensitive to light. By randomly masking different parts, effectively a non-regular sampling of a higher resolution image is performed. Combining a properly designed mask and a high-quality reconstruction algorithm, a higher image quality can be achieved than using a low-resolution sensor and subsequent upsampling. For the latter case, the image quality can be enhanced using super resolution algorithms. Recently, algorithms based on machine learning such as the Very Deep Super Resolution network (VDSR) proofed to be successful for this task. In this work, we transfer the concepts of VDSR to the special case of quarter sampling. Besides adapting the network layout to take advantage of the case of quarter sampling, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique enabled by quarter sampling. Altogether, using the quarter sampling sensor, the image quality in terms of PSNR can be increased by + 0.67 dB for the Urban 100 dataset compared to using a low-resolution sensor with VDSR.",

        "abstract": "A new general classification approach is presented that uses the geometric shape of spectral signatures instead of purely statistical methods and can be used for classification by a rule-based procedure with IF-THEN queries. Due to its high spatial and spectral information content, hyperspectral imaging opens up new possibilities for a better understanding of data and scenes in a wide variety of applications. An essential part of this process of understanding is the classification part. However, the high spatial and spectral resolution also leads to enormous amounts of data. The effective handling and use of such datasets for classification requires processing steps (dimensionality reduction through feature selection or feature extraction) that are not always goal-oriented. In this article, a new general classification approach is presented that uses the geometric shape of spectral signatures instead of purely statistical methods. In contrast to classical classification approaches (e.g., SVM, KNN), not only are reflectance values taken into account, but also parameters such as curvature points, curvature values, and the curvature behavior of spectral signatures are used to develop shape-describing rules in order to use them for classification by a rule-based procedure with IF-THEN queries. The flexibility and efficiency of the methodology are demonstrated on datasets from two different application domains and lead to convincing results with good performance.",

Dimensionality reduction (DR) is an effective preprocessing step in hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis. A particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based unsupervised DR method is proposed in the present paper where spectral divergence as well as spatial gradient information is used in selecting informative bands. In general, HSI is negatively affected by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Hence, in the proposed method, a noise filter is applied to minimize the effect of noise in band selection. Clustering is introduced to reduce spatial redundancy and extract distinct patterns from the data. This enables improvement in the computation performance of each iteration in PSO. The proposed method is applied on two standard datasets, and the performance is evaluated using overall classification accuracy. Finally, results are compared with other recent state-of-the-art methods where the proposed method performed reasonably better than other tested methods in terms of consistency and classification accuracy.",

        "abstract": "A stateless FL algorithm that achieves faster convergence (i.e., fewer communica- tion rounds) and higher overall converged performance than SOTA methods under non-IID data distribution and does not impose unrealistic limits on the client size. Federated Learning (FL) seeks to distribute model training across local clients without collecting data in a centralized data-center, hence removing data-privacy concerns. A major challenge for FL is data heterogeneity (where each client\u2019s data distribution can differ) as it can lead to weight divergence among local clients and slow global convergence. The current SOTA FL methods designed for data heterogeneity typically impose regularization to limit the impact of non-IID data and are stateful algorithms, i.e., they maintain local statistics over time. While effective, these approaches can only be used for a special case of FL involving only a small number of reli- able clients. For the more typical applications of FL where the number of clients is large (e.g., edge-device and mobile ap- plications), these methods cannot be applied, motivating the need for a stateless approach to heterogeneous FL which can be used for any number of clients. We derive a \ufb01rst-order gradient regularization to penalize inconsistent local updates due to local data heterogeneity. Speci\ufb01cally, to mitigate weight divergence, we introduce a \ufb01rst-order approximation of the global data distribution into local objectives, which intuitively penalizes updates in the opposite direction of the global up- date. The end result is a stateless FL algorithm that achieves 1) signi\ufb01cantly faster convergence (i.e., fewer communica- tion rounds) and 2) higher overall converged performance than SOTA methods under non-IID data distribution. Impor- tantly, our approach does not impose unrealistic limits on the client size, enabling learning from a large number of clients as is typical in most FL applications Our code will be released at https://github.com/GT-RIPL/FedFOR.",

        "abstract": "A predictive machine learning model is proposed to detect and classify network activity in an IoT system that distinguishes between normal and anomaly network activity and classifies network traffic into five categories. Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications have rapidly expanded worldwide due to their benefits in improving the business environment, industrial environment, and people\u2019s daily lives. However, IoT devices are not immune to malicious network traffic, which causes potential negative consequences and sabotages IoT operating devices. Therefore, developing a method for screening network traffic is necessary to detect and classify malicious activity to mitigate its negative impacts. This research proposes a predictive machine learning model to detect and classify network activity in an IoT system. Specifically, our model distinguishes between normal and anomaly network activity. Furthermore, it classifies network traffic into five categories: normal, Mirai attack, denial of service (DoS) attack, Scan attack, and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. Five supervised learning models were implemented to characterize their performance in detecting and classifying network activities for IoT systems. This includes the following models: shallow neural networks (SNN), decision trees (DT), bagging trees (BT), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and support vector machine (SVM). The learning models were evaluated on a new and broad dataset for IoT attacks, the IoTID20 dataset. Besides, a deep feature engineering process was used to improve the learning models\u2019 accuracy. Our experimental evaluation exhibited an accuracy of 100% recorded for the detection using all implemented models and an accuracy of 99.4\u201399.9% recorded for the classification process.",

Developers of cloud-native applications have rapidly adopted the Serverless/Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) paradigm as it exempts them from provisioning and operating the infrastructure. Within this context, an interesting approach that can foster IoT applications\u2019 development is extending the serverless paradigm towards the network edge to cover IoT environments: a paradigm that we refer to as \u2018deviceless\u2019. In this approach, an IoT infrastructure composed of devices deployed at the network edge can seamlessly be integrated as an application execution infrastructure to enable interactions with hosted sensors/actuators. This paper discusses several perspectives available in the literature on the (IoT) edge-based serverless paradigm and related use cases in an IoT/edge computing context. Besides, we present our preliminary prototype for implementing the deviceless approach to show its viability. We exploit the deviceless paradigm to conceive data pipelines under a flow-based development environment leveraging a geographically distributed IoT infrastructure.",

        "abstract": "In VMALS, a variable neighborhood search is applied to nondominated solutions generated by ACO to approximate the true Pareto front better and two novel crossover and mutation-based neighborhood structures are devised to enhance the local search capability of VNS. Effective workflow scheduling is essential to obtain high execution performance of workflow applications in cloud computing and remains a challenging problem. Due to the commercial nature of clouds, the execution cost of a workflow is a crucial issue for cloud users except for the execution time (makespan). We formulate the cloud workflow scheduling as a multiobjective optimization problem to minimize both execution cost and makespan. A Variable neighborhood search-based Multiobjective Ant colony optimization (ACO)-List Scheduling approach (VMALS) is proposed to address it. In VMALS, the list scheduling is first integrated into the ACO-based multiobjective optimization to consider the effect of different task scheduling sequences on the execution cost and makespan of a workflow. Then, a variable neighborhood search (VNS) is applied to nondominated solutions generated by ACO to approximate the true Pareto front better. Moreover, two novel crossover and mutation-based neighborhood structures are devised to enhance the local search capability of VNS. VMALS is compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results show that VMALS performs better than the comparative algorithms, and the average value of hypervolume metric of VMALS is 3.54\u201386.18% higher than that of comparative algorithms.",

        "abstract": "The off-policy reinforcement learning is proposed to approach the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation under the framework of centralized training and decentralized execution and the actor-critic structure is adopted to learn the optimal control policies. In this paper, the optimal coordinated control problem for the homogeneous multi-agent graphical games with completely unknown dynamics is investigated. The off-policy reinforcement learning is proposed to approach the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation under the framework of centralized training and decentralized execution. The actor-critic structure is adopted to learn the optimal control policies. Note that the critic network is centralized using the information from all the agents, and the parameter sharing scheme is adopted for the single actor network during the training process. For the execution process, the centralized critic network is not required, and only the trained actor network is used for each agent to obtain the control input based on its individual observation. For the implementation purpose, the neural network approximators with the actor-critic structure are constructed to approach the optimal centralized value function and the optimal policies for the multiagent graphical games. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel iterative solution for the data owner to gradually \u201cdisentangle\u201d the anomalous entries from the benign ones such that the third-party analyst can produce accurate anomaly results with suf\ufb01cient DP guarantee. \u2014Outsourcing anomaly detection to third-parties can allow data owners to overcome resource constraints (e.g., in lightweight IoT devices), facilitate collaborative analysis (e.g., under distributed or multi-party scenarios), and bene\ufb01t from lower costs and specialized expertise (e.g., of Managed Security Service Providers). Despite such bene\ufb01ts, a data owner may feel reluctant to outsource anomaly detection without suf\ufb01cient privacy protection. To that end, most existing privacy solutions would face a novel challenge, i.e., preserving privacy usually requires the difference between data entries to be eliminated or reduced, whereas anomaly detection critically depends on that difference. Such a con\ufb02ict is recently resolved under a local analysis setting with trusted analysts (where no outsourcing is involved) through moving the focus of differential privacy (DP) guarantee from \u201call\u201d to only \u201cbenign\u201d entries. In this paper, we observe that such an approach is not directly applicable to the outsourcing setting, because data owners do not know which entries are \u201cbenign\u201d prior to outsourcing, and hence cannot selectively apply DP on data entries. Therefore, we propose a novel iterative solution for the data owner to gradually \u201cdisentangle\u201d the anomalous entries from the benign ones such that the third-party analyst can produce accurate anomaly results with suf\ufb01cient DP guarantee. We design and implement our D ifferentially P rivate O utsourcing of A nomaly D etection ( DPOAD ) framework, and demonstrate its bene\ufb01ts over baseline Laplace and PainFree mechanisms through experiments with real data from different application domains.",

        "abstract": "This chapter deals with a comprehensive outline of methodological perspectives and practical uses of verification and validation in the context of simulating social complexity and the problem of evaluating simulations. Verification and validation are two important aspects of model building. Verification and validation compare models with observations and descriptions of the problem modelled, which may include other models that have been verified and validated to some level. However, the use of simulation for modelling social complexity is very diverse. Often, verification and validation do not refer to an explicit stage in the simulation development process, but to the modelling process itself, according to good practices and in a way that grants credibility to using the simulation for a specific purpose. One cannot consider verification and validation without considering the purpose of the simulation. This chapter deals with a comprehensive outline of methodological perspectives and practical uses of verification and validation. The problem of evaluating simulations is addressed in four main topics: (1) the meaning of the terms verification and validation in the context of simulating social complexity; (2) types of validation, as well as techniques for validating simulations; (3) model replication and comparison as cornerstones of verification and validation; and (4) the relationship of various validation types and techniques with different modelling strategies.",

        "abstract": "A novel model called Spatio-Temporal AutoEncoding (ST AutoEncoder or STAE), which utilizes deep neural networks to learn video representation automatically and extracts features from both spatial and temporal dimensions by performing 3-dimensional convolutions, which enhances the motion feature learning in videos. Anomalous events detection in real-world video scenes is a challenging problem due to the complexity of \"anomaly\" as well as the cluttered backgrounds, objects and motions in the scenes. Most existing methods use hand-crafted features in local spatial regions to identify anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Spatio-Temporal AutoEncoder (ST AutoEncoder or STAE), which utilizes deep neural networks to learn video representation automatically and extracts features from both spatial and temporal dimensions by performing 3-dimensional convolutions. In addition to the reconstruction loss used in existing typical autoencoders, we introduce a weight-decreasing prediction loss for generating future frames, which enhances the motion feature learning in videos. Since most anomaly detection datasets are restricted to appearance anomalies or unnatural motion anomalies, we collected a new challenging dataset comprising a set of real-world traffic surveillance videos. Several experiments are performed on both the public benchmarks and our traffic dataset, which show that our proposed method remarkably outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes Mask Aware Network (MAN) including a mask generation module and a loss function searching module and demonstrates the robustness and generalization of the method in both standard or masked face recognition task. Face recognition is one of the most important research topics for intelligence security system, especially in the COVID-19 era. Medical research has proven that wearing a mask is the most efficient way to avoid the risk of COVID-19. Nevertheless, classic face recognition systems often fail when dealing with masked faces. So it is essential to design a method that is robust to Masked Face Recognition (MFR). In this paper, to relieve the degraded performance of MFR, we propose Mask Aware Network (MAN) including a mask generation module and a loss function searching module. The mask generation module utilizes the face landmarks to obtain more realistic and reliable masked faces for training. The loss function searching module tries to match the most suitable loss for face recognition. On ICCV MFR challenge, our team victor-2021 achieves 5 first places (including 3 champions in standard face recognition and 2 champions in masked face recognition) and 1 third place by 3rd August 2021. These results demonstrate the robustness and generalization of our method in both standard or masked face recognition task.",

        "abstract": "The experimental results demonstrated that SREM produces good image data, which will not only greatly improve the range of applications for HS data but also encourage more utilization of MS data. Hyperspectral (HS) remote sensing has an important role in a wide variety of fields. However, its rapid progress has been constrained due to the narrow swath of HS images. This paper proposes a spectral resolution enhancement method (SREM) for remotely sensed multispectral (MS) image, to generate wide swath HS images using auxiliary multi/hyper-spectral data. Firstly, a set number of spectra of different materials are extracted from both the MS and HS data. Secondly, the approach makes use of the linear relationships between multi and hyper-spectra of specific materials to generate a set of transformation matrices. Then, a spectral angle weighted minimum distance (SAWMD) matching method is used to select a suitable matrix to create HS vectors from the original MS image, pixel by pixel. The final result image data has the same spectral resolution as the original HS data that used and the spatial resolution and swath were also the same as for the original MS data. The derived transformation matrices can also be used to generate multitemporal HS data from MS data for different periods. The approach was tested with three image datasets, and the spectra-enhanced and real HS data were compared by visual interpretation, statistical analysis, and classification to evaluate the performance. The experimental results demonstrated that SREM produces good image data, which will not only greatly improve the range of applications for HS data but also encourage more utilization of MS data.",

        "abstract": "A novel network block is developed, called RFT-MSA block, which includes the region-of-interest (RoI) feature transformation (RFT) and the multiscale-spectral-attention (MSA) module as to reduce the spatial and spectral redundancies simultaneously and provide strong discrimination. Target detection plays a core issue in hyperspectral remote sensing, but faces serious challenges of how to deal with the spatial and spectral redundancies and spectral variations. In this article, a novel network block is developed, called RFT-MSA block (abbreviated as RM), which includes the region-of-interest (RoI) feature transformation (RFT) and the multiscale-spectral-attention (MSA) module as to reduce the spatial and spectral redundancies simultaneously and provide strong discrimination. Furthermore, a deep spatial\u2013spectral network (DSSN) is presented by stacking several RM and deconvolutional (DC) blocks for hyperspectral target detection in an unsupervised manner, and a feature loss term is investigated to simultaneously restrict the target to be sparse and minimize the energy of the background. The proposed algorithm mainly consists of three steps. First, an RoI map is detected using a classical detector (no statistic assumption is needed) with an edge-preserving filter. Then, the hyperspectral image (HSI) and the corresponding RoI map are considered as inputs to the DSSN for extracting the spatial and spectral feature of interest (SSFI). Finally, we apply the nearest neighbors (NNs) to the SSFI for detection-map refinement. The experimental results on one synthetic and three real HSIs demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmark approaches in detection performance and robustness. In addition, further analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed RM block.",

Popular methods of protecting access such as Personal Identification Numbers and smart cards are subject to security risks that result from accidental loss or being stolen. Risk can be reduced by adopting direct methods that identify the person and these are generally biometric methods, such as iris, face, voice and fingerprint recognition approaches. In this paper, a finger vein recognition method has been implemented in which the effect on performance has of using principal components analysis has been investigated. The data were obtained from the finger-vein database SDMULA-HMT and the images underwent contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization and noise filtering for contrast improvement. The vein pattern was extracted using repeated line tracking and dimensionality reduction using principal components analysis to generate the feature vector. A \u2018speeded-up robust features\u2019 algorithm was used to determine the key points of interest and the Euclidean Distance was used to estimate similarity between database images. The results show that the use of a suitable number of principal components can improve the accuracy and reduce the computational overhead of the verification system.",

        "abstract": "A novel end-to-end neural network to reconstruct high resolution images from non-regularly sampled sensor data is proposed, a concatenation of a locally fully connected reconstruction network (LFCR) and a standard VDSR network. Quarter sampling and three-quarter sampling are novel sensor concepts that enable the acquisition of higher resolution images without increasing the number of pixels. This is achieved by non-regularly covering parts of each pixel of a low-resolution sensor such that only one quadrant or three quadrants of the sensor area of each pixel is sensitive to light. Combining a properly designed mask and a high-quality reconstruction algorithm, a higher image quality can be achieved than using a low-resolution sensor and subsequent upsampling. For the latter case, the image quality can be further enhanced using super resolution algorithms such as the very deep super resolution network (VDSR). In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network to reconstruct high resolution images from non-regularly sampled sensor data. The network is a concatenation of a locally fully connected reconstruction network (LFCR) and a standard VDSR network. Altogether, using a three-quarter sampling sensor with our novel neural network layout, the image quality in terms of PSNR for the Urban100 dataset can be increased by 2.96 dB compared to the state-of-the-art approach. Compared to a low-resolution sensor with VDSR, a gain of 1.11 dB is achieved.",

        "abstract": "Pansharpening technology is used to acquire a multispectral image with high spatial resolution from a panchromatic (PAN) image and a multispectral (MS) image. The detail injection model is popular for its flexibility. However, the accuracy of the injection gain and the extracted details may greatly influence the quality of the pansharpened image. This paper proposes an adaptive injection model to solve these problems. For detail extraction, we present a Gaussian filter estimation algorithm by exploring the intrinsic character of the MS sensor and convolving the PAN image with the filter to adaptively optimize the details to be consistent with the character of the MS image. For the adaptive injection coefficient, we iteratively adjust the coefficient by balancing the spectral and spatial fidelity. By multiplying the optimized details and injection gain, the final HRMS is obtained with the injection model. The performance of the proposed model is analyzed and a large number of tests are carried out on various satellite datasets. Compared to some advanced pansharpening methods, the results prove that our method can achieve the best fusion quality both subjectively and objectively.",

        "abstract": "A modified version of the same algorithm is introduced by considering chaotic sequence based initialization instead of the random number based initialization to address the band selection problem. Hyperspectral image comprise of a three dimensional image cube. Two dimension represents the regular image collected on a specific band of frequency. There are hundreds of such correlated bands present in this three dimensional cube. To effectively process and extract significant information from the hyper-spectral image there is a need to eliminate some of the bands which carry repetitive information, sometimes noisy in nature. In IEEE iSES 2021 symposium, a binary multi-objective CLONAL algorithm is reported by the same author to address the band selection problem. In this paper, a modified version of the same algorithm is introduced by considering chaotic sequence based initialization instead of the random number based initialization. Entropy and Pearson correlation are used as the fitness function for multi-objective optimization. Simulation have been performed on hyperspectral images of Pavia University, Kennedy Space Centre. On the obtained band reduced images image segmentation is carried out using K-modes clustering. Comparison is carried out with the results obtained with random number based same algorithm, binary social spider algorithm, NSGA-II algorithm and principal component algorithm.",

Multi-center heterogeneous data are a hot topic in federated learning. The data of clients and centers do not follow a normal distribution, posing significant challenges to learning. Based on the assumption that the client data have a multivariate skewed normal distribution, we improve the DP-Fed-mv-PPCA model. We use a Bayesian framework to construct prior distributions of local parameters and use expectation maximization and pseudo-Newton algorithms to obtain robust parameter estimates. Then, the clipping algorithm and differential privacy algorithm are used to solve the problem in which the model parameters do not have a display solution and achieve privacy guarantee. Furthermore, we verified the effectiveness of our model using synthetic and actual data from the Internet of vehicles.",

        "abstract": "The existing machine learning and deep learning techniques in the literature and the datasets used to detect abnormal events in surveillance videos are examined to show their advantages and disadvantages and summarize the literature studies, highlighting the major challenges. Surveillance cameras have recently been utilized to provide physical security services globally in diverse private and public spaces. The number of cameras has been increasing rapidly due to the need for monitoring and recording abnormal events. This process can be difficult and time-consuming when detecting anomalies using human power to monitor them for special security purposes. Abnormal events deviate from normal patterns and are considered rare. Furthermore, collecting or producing data on these rare events and modeling abnormal data are difficult. Therefore, there is a need to develop an intelligent approach to overcome this challenge. Many research studies have been conducted on detecting abnormal events using machine learning and deep learning techniques. This study focused on abnormal event detection, particularly for video surveillance applications, and included an up-to-date state-of-the-art that extends previous related works. The major objective of this survey was to examine the existing machine learning and deep learning techniques in the literature and the datasets used to detect abnormal events in surveillance videos to show their advantages and disadvantages and summarize the literature studies, highlighting the major challenges.",

Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their promise for substantial and long-term benefits to society, economy, environment, and citizens. In addition, the rapid advances in computing, communication, and storage technologies have resulted in a revolution in the information communication technology domain and domination in the industry context. The utilization of CPSs in industrial settings has led to industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs), which, in conjunction with the information-driven interactions, enables large-scale cooperation in industrial facilities and among all the stakeholders of the value chain. Hence, the research on ICPSs is essential, especially with respect to the engineering of such systems for industrial applications. This article presents an overview of recent developments in ICPSs. We first introduce the architecture of ICPSs. Then, we review the developments of ICPSs in relevant research domains. Finally, this article concludes by presenting some potential future research directions on ICPSs.",

        "abstract": "A novel multiobjective ant colony system based on a co-evolutionary multiple populations for multiple objectives framework is proposed, which adopts two colonies to deal with these two objectives, respectively. Cloud workflow scheduling is significantly challenging due to not only the large scale of workflow but also the elasticity and heterogeneity of cloud resources. Moreover, the pricing model of clouds makes the execution time and execution cost two critical issues in the scheduling. This paper models the cloud workflow scheduling as a multiobjective optimization problem that optimizes both execution time and execution cost. A novel multiobjective ant colony system based on a co-evolutionary multiple populations for multiple objectives framework is proposed, which adopts two colonies to deal with these two objectives, respectively. Moreover, the proposed approach incorporates with the following three novel designs to efficiently deal with the multiobjective challenges: 1) a new pheromone update rule based on a set of nondominated solutions from a global archive to guide each colony to search its optimization objective sufficiently; 2) a complementary heuristic strategy to avoid a colony only focusing on its corresponding single optimization objective, cooperating with the pheromone update rule to balance the search of both objectives; and 3) an elite study strategy to improve the solution quality of the global archive to help further approach the global Pareto front. Experimental simulations are conducted on five types of real-world scientific workflows and consider the properties of Amazon EC2 cloud platform. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than both some state-of-the-art multiobjective optimization approaches and the constrained optimization approaches.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a faster scheme based on value iteration, using Q-function in an online manner to solve the Nash equilibrium of the system, and shows that the convergence speed of this scheme is about 10 times faster than that of the policy iteration algorithm. Solving the Nash equilibrium is important for multi-agent game systems, and the speed of reaching Nash equilibrium is critical for the agent to quickly make real-time decisions. A typical scheme is the model-free reinforcement learning algorithm based on policy iteration, which is slow because each iteration will be calculated from the start state to the end state. In this paper, we propose a faster scheme based on value iteration, using Q-function in an online manner to solve the Nash equilibrium of the system. Since the calculation is based on the value from the last iteration, the convergence speed of the proposed scheme is much faster than the policy iteration. The rationality and convergence of this scheme are analyzed and proved theoretically. An actor-critic network structure is used to implement this scheme through simulation. The simulation results show that the convergence speed of our proposed scheme is about 10 times faster than that of the policy iteration algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper first defines privacy in the context of collaborative outlier detection, then develops a novel method to find outliers from both horizontally partitioned and vertically partitioned categorical data in a privacy-preserving manner and provides an end-to-end privacy guarantee. Outlier detection is one of the most important data analytics tasks and is used in numerous applications and domains. The goal of outlier detection is to find abnormal entities that are significantly different from the remaining data. Often the underlying data is distributed across different organizations. If outlier detection is done locally, the results obtained are not as accurate as when outlier detection is done collaboratively over the combined data. However, the data cannot be easily integrated into a single database due to privacy and legal concerns. In this paper, we address precisely this problem. We first define privacy in the context of collaborative outlier detection. We then develop a novel method to find outliers from both horizontally partitioned and vertically partitioned categorical data in a privacy-preserving manner. Our method is based on a scalable outlier detection technique that uses attribute value frequencies. We provide an end-to-end privacy guarantee by using the differential privacy model and secure multiparty computation techniques. Experiments on real data show that our proposed technique is both effective and efficient.",

Modeling abnormal spatiotemporal events is challenging since data belonging to abnormal activities are less in the course of a surveillance stream. We solve this issue using a normality modeling approach, where abnormalities are detected as deviations from the normal patterns. To this end, we propose a residual spatiotemporal autoencoder, which is trainable end-to-end to carry out the anomaly detection task in surveillance videos. Irregularities are detected using the reconstruction loss, where normal frames are reconstructed well with a low reconstruction cost, and the converse is identified as abnormal frames. We evaluate the effect of residual connections in the STAE architecture and presented good practices to train an autoencoder for video anomaly detection using benchmark datasets, namely CUHK-Avenue, UCSD-Ped2, and Live Videos. Comparisons with the existing approaches prove that the effectiveness of residual blocks is incremental than going deeper with additional layers to train a spatiotemporal autoencoder with good generalization across datasets.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a novel training approach, termed Faster Face Classification (F2C), to alleviate time and cost without sacrificing the performance, and proves that the speed is faster than state-of-the-art FC-based methods in terms of recognition accuracy and hardware costs. Face recognition has achieved significant progress in deep learning era due to the ultra-large-scale and well- labeled datasets. However, training on the outsize datasets is time-consuming and takes up a lot of hardware resource. Therefore, designing an efficient training approach is in- dispensable. The heavy computational and memory costs mainly result from the million-level dimensionality of the fully connected (FC) layer. To this end, we propose a novel training approach, termed Faster Face Classification (F2C), to alleviate time and cost without sacrificing the performance. This method adopts Dynamic Class Pool (DCP) for storing and updating the identities' features dy-namically, which could be regarded as a substitute for the FC layer. DCP is efficiently time-saving and cost-saving, as its smaller size with the independence from the whole face identities together. We further validate the proposed F2C method across several face benchmarks and private datasets, and display comparable results, meanwhile the speed is faster than state-of-the-art FC-based methods in terms of recognition accuracy and hardware costs. More-over, our method is further improved by a well-designed dual data loader including indentity-based and instance- based loaders, which makes it more efficient for updating DCP parameters.",

        "abstract": "A new spectral resolution enhancement method for cloud removal (SREM-CR) from hyperspectral images, with the help of an auxiliary cloud-free multispectral image acquired at different times. ABSTRACT Hyperspectral remote sensing plays an important role in a wide variety of fields. However, its specific application for land surface analysis has been constrained due to the different shapes of thick, opaque cloud cover. The reconstruction of missing information obscured by clouds in remote-sensing images is an area of active research. However, most of the available cloud-removal methods are not suitable for hyperspectral images, because they lose the spectral information which is very important for hyperspectral analysis. In this article, we developed a new spectral resolution enhancement method for cloud removal (SREM-CR) from hyperspectral images, with the help of an auxiliary cloud-free multispectral image acquired at different times. In the fixed hyperspectral image, spectra of the cloud cover pixels are reconstructed depending on the relationship between the original hyperspectral and multispectral images. The final resulting image has the same spectral resolution as the original hyperspectral image but without clouds. This approach was tested on two experiments, in which the results were compared by visual interpretation and statistical indices. Our method demonstrated good performance.",

        "abstract": "Food incidents have led to the increase in demand for food products certified by an international quality assurance certification of consumers all over the world. Shrimp is an important daily food product. As one of the largest shrimp production countries with the export-orientation, Vietnamese shrimp producers have to consider applying for the international quality assurances certifications to be able to satisfy the requirements of global consumers, and access to global markets, especially the high-standard markets such as the US, EU, and Japan. Despite the significant benefits obtained from the international quality assurance certifications, the application schemes for Vietnamese shrimp products were limited. It was due to the lack of awareness of the financial benefits of getting quality assurance certification for a multiplicity of shrimp farmers. This study aims to investigate the effects of application for international quality assurance certifications on the profit of Vietnamese shrimp farms. The Tobit regression model has been explored to achieve the purposive study. Found results indicated that the application for quality assurance certification might increase the profitability of shrimp farmers (p < 0.05), proposed this might be a meaningful alternative to improve the financial efficiency, and to call for the willingness to apply for international quality assurances certification of shrimp farmers. Besides that, other influencing factors, including cultivation methods, production costs, and farm-gate price, have been found as the significant determinants affecting the shrimp farm\u2019s profit (p < 0.05). This suggests that a well-management in financial indicators might generate a better profit for shrimp farms.",

        "abstract": "A novel method of constructing training samples using only the image itself and the limited prior information is proposed, suitable for target detection based on the Siamese network framework, which shows its unique advantages in suppressing the background to a low level and highlighting the target with high probability. Hyperspectral target detection can be described as locating targets of interest within a hyperspectral image based on prior information of targets. The complexity of actual scenes limits the performance of traditional statistical methods that rely on model assumptions, and traditional machine learning methods rely on mapping functions with limited complexity. To address these problems, we propose a Siamese transformer network for hyperspectral image target detection (STTD). The contribution of this article is threefold. First, we propose a novel method of constructing training samples using only the image itself and the limited prior information, which is suitable for target detection based on the Siamese network framework. Second, the Siamese network framework is utilized to solve the problem of similarity metric learning, i.e., make homogeneous features as close as possible and heterogeneous features as far as possible. Third, the most state-of-the-art network, transformer, is applied as the backbone of our proposed Siamese network to extract global features from spectra with long-range dependencies to achieve target detection. Furthermore, we make adaptive improvements to transformer for hyperspectral images. The proposed method shows its unique advantages in suppressing the background to a low level and highlighting the target with high probability. Experiments on five different datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed STTD as compared to the state-of-the-art.",

The pace of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) change has accelerated due to population growth, industrialization, and economic development. To understand and analyze this transformation, it is essential to examine changes in LULC meticulously. LULC classification is a fundamental and complex task that plays a significant role in farming decision making and urban planning for long-term development in the earth observation system. Recent advances in deep learning, transfer learning, and remote sensing technology have simplified the LULC classification problem. Deep transfer learning is particularly useful for addressing the issue of insufficient training data because it reduces the need for equally distributed data. In this study, thirty-nine deep transfer learning models were systematically evaluated alongside multiple deep transfer learning models for LULC classification using a consistent set of criteria. Our experiments will be conducted under controlled conditions to provide valuable insights for future research on LULC classification using deep transfer learning models. Among our models, ResNet50, EfficientNetV2B0, and ResNet152 were the top performers in terms of kappa and accuracy scores. ResNet152 required three times longer training time than EfficientNetV2B0 on our test computer, while ResNet50 took roughly twice as long. ResNet50 achieved an overall f1-score of 0.967 on the test set, with the Highway class having the lowest score and the Sea Lake class having the highest.",

        "abstract": "This work demonstrates that the corresponding eigenvalue may in fact also contain useful local information that is important in identification and so should be retained in the feature vectors before they undergo dimensionality reduction using PCA. With the large number of people travelling internationally, there is an increasing demand to be able to deal with security clearance rapidly and with a minimum of inconvenience. Using finger vein biometric traits fulfils these requirements. In previously-reported work, the data obtained from finger veins underwent dimensionality reduction using principal components analysis (PCA) followed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and this was shown to improve the identification rate compared to the more commonly applied Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Although PCA was found to be effective at reducing the noise residing in the discarded dimension, this work demonstrates that the corresponding eigenvalue may in fact also contain useful local information that is important in identification and so should be retained. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes the use of feature extraction using DWT and local binary patterns (LBPs) to generate the feature vectors, before they undergo dimensionality reduction using PCA. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used for classification. The performance of the proposed method was compared with previous work, with the identification rate of the proposed method offering the best accuracy of 95.8%.",

        "abstract": "A faster version of L-JSDE called recurrent L- JSDE (RL-JS DE) is proposed which is a reformulation of L -JSDE which provides significant speedups on both CPU and GPU without sacrificing image quality. Recently, non-regular three-quarter sampling has shown to deliver an increased image quality of image sensors by using differently oriented L-shaped pixels compared to the same number of square pixels. A three-quarter sampling sensor can be understood as a conventional low-resolution sensor where one quadrant of each square pixel is opaque. Subsequent to the measurement, the data can be reconstructed on a regular grid with twice the resolution in both spatial dimensions using an appropriate reconstruction algorithm. For this reconstruction, local joint sparse deconvolution and extrapolation (L-JSDE) has shown to perform very well. As a disadvantage, L-JSDE requires long computation times of several dozen minutes per megapixel. In this paper, we propose a faster version of L-JSDE called recurrent L-JSDE (RL-JSDE) which is a reformulation of L-JSDE. For reasonable recurrent measurement patterns, RL-JSDE provides significant speedups on both CPU and GPU without sacrificing image quality. Compared to L-JSDE, 20-fold and 733-fold speedups are achieved on CPU and GPU, respectively.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a leaf goes through some pre-processing to extract its refined color image, vein image, xy-projection histogram, handcrafted shape, texture features, and Fourier descriptors before a support vector machine (SVM) model is utilized to classify different leaves. There is a warning light for the loss of plant habitats worldwide that entails concerted efforts to conserve plant biodiversity. Thus, plant species classification is crucial to address this environmental challenge. In recent years, there has been a considerable increase in studies related to plant taxonomy. While some researchers try to improve their recognition performance using novel approaches, others concentrate on computational optimization for their framework. In addition, a few studies are diving into feature extraction to gain significantly in terms of accuracy. This paper proposes an effective method for the leaf recognition problem. In our proposed approach, a leaf goes through some pre-processing to extract its refined color image, vein image, xy-projection histogram, handcrafted shape, texture features, and Fourier descriptors. These attributes are then transformed into a better representation by neural network-based encoders before a support vector machine (SVM) model is utilized to classify different leaves. Overall, our approach performs a state-of-the-art result on the Flavia leaf dataset, achieving the accuracy of 99.69% on test sets under random 10-fold cross-validation and bypassing the previous methods. Another important contribution is the trade-offs in classification performance while minimizing the feature categories used. In order to tackle this challenge, we designed several empirical experiments to analyze the performance of different combinations of feature sources and choose the best combination for features for the main problem. We also release our codes (Scripts are available at https://github.com/Tayerquach/flavia_recognition ) for contributing to the research community in the leaf classification problem.",

        "abstract": "A unified pansharpening model based on the band-adaptive gradient and detail correction is proposed, which can achieve the best results in terms of fusion quality and has high efficiency. Pansharpening is used to fuse a panchromatic (PAN) image with a multispectral (MS) image to obtain a high-spatial-resolution multispectral (HRMS) image. Traditional pansharpening methods face difficulties in obtaining accurate details and have low computational efficiency. In this study, a unified pansharpening model based on the band-adaptive gradient and detail correction is proposed. First, a spectral fidelity constraint is designed by keeping each band of the HRMS image consistent with that of the MS image. Then, a band-adaptive gradient correction model is constructed by exploring the gradient relationship between a PAN image and each band of the MS image, so as to adaptively obtain an accurate spatial structure for the estimated HRMS image. To refine the spatial details, a detail correction constraint is defined based on the parameter transfer by designing a reduced-scale parameter acquisition model. Finally, a unified model is constructed based on the gradient and detail corrections, which is then solved by an alternating direction multiplier method. Both reduced-scale and full-scale experiments are conducted on several datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art pansharpening methods, the proposed method can achieve the best results in terms of fusion quality and has high efficiency. Specifically, our method improves the SAM and ERGAS metrics by 17.6% and 21.2% respectively compared to the traditional approach with the best average values, and improves these two metrics by 4.3% and 10.3% respectively compared to the learning-based approach with the best average values.",

        "abstract": "A dimension reduction technique based on binary multi-objective CLONAL algorithm has been proposed that uses two objective functions as entropy and Pearson correlation to extract only those bands which are informative and eliminate the noisy and redundant bands. A hyperspectral image collects the spectral information across the electromagnetic spectrum as a continuous set of hundreds of bands with a very narrow bandwidths ranging from 5-10nm. The bands are high correlated with each other and some of the bands carry negligible information. So, there is a need to reduce the dimensionality of the hyperspectral image. Thus the aim is to extract only those bands which are informative and eliminate the noisy and redundant bands. If the redundant bands are eliminated, the dimensionality of the hyperspectral image reduces. This reduction in dimensionality reduces the cost of computation and increases the accuracy of the analysis. In this paper, a dimension reduction technique based on binary multi-objective CLONAL algorithm has been proposed. The method uses two objective functions as entropy and Pearson correlation. The extracted spectral bands are taken and extracted hyperspectral image obtained is segmented using K-modes algorithm. Comparative results reveal superior performance of band selection by the proposed method over NSGA-II, BSSO and PCA based reduction.",

        "abstract": "A novel FL framework, federated lazy aggregation (FedLA), which reduces aggregation frequency to obtain high-quality gradients and improve robustness in non-IID scenarios and can also be improved in IID scenarios is proposed. Federated learning (FL) is a distributed neural network training paradigm with privacy protection. With the premise of ensuring that local data are not leaked, the multi-device cooperation trains the model and improves its normalization. Unlike centralized training, FL is susceptible to heterogeneous data, biased gradient estimations hinder the convergence of the global model, and traditional sampling techniques cannot apply FL due to privacy constraints. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel FL framework, federated lazy aggregation (FedLA), which reduces aggregation frequency to obtain high-quality gradients and improve robustness in non-IID. To judge the aggregating timings, the change rate of the models\u2019 weight divergence (WDR) is introduced to FL. Furthermore, the collected gradients also facilitate FL walking out of the saddle point without extra communications. The cross-device momentum (CDM) mechanism could significantly improve the upper limit performance of the global model in non-IID. We evaluate the performance of several popular algorithms, including FedLA and FedLA with momentum (FedLAM). The results show that FedLAM achieves the best performance in most scenarios and the performance of FL can also be improved in IID scenarios.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a novel federated learning paradigm to model data variability among heterogeneous clients in multi-centric studies through a hierarchical Bayesian latent variable model, and shows that this framework can be effectively optimized through expectation maximization over latent master's distribution and clients' parameters. We propose a novel federated learning paradigm to model data variability among heterogeneous clients in multi-centric studies. Our method is expressed through a hierarchical Bayesian latent variable model, where client-specific parameters are assumed to be realization from a global distribution at the master level, which is in turn estimated to account for data bias and variability across clients. We show that our framework can be effectively optimized through expectation maximization (EM) over latent master's distribution and clients' parameters. We also introduce formal differential privacy (DP) guarantees compatibly with our EM optimization scheme. We tested our method on the analysis of multi-modal medical imaging data and clinical scores from distributed clinical datasets of patients affected by Alzheimer's disease. We demonstrate that our method is robust when data is distributed either in iid and non-iid manners, even when local parameters perturbation is included to provide DP guarantees. Our approach allows to quantify the variability of data, views and centers, while guaranteeing high-quality data reconstruction as compared to the state-of-the-art autoencoding models and federated learning schemes.The code is available at https://gitlab.inria.fr/epione/federated-multi-views-ppca",

        "abstract": "A detailed review of the recent development of anomaly detection methods from the perspectives of computer vision on different available datasets is presented. With the widespread use of closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance systems in public areas, crowd anomaly detection has become an increasingly critical aspect of the intelligent video surveillance system. It requires workforce and continuous attention to decide on the captured event, which is hard to perform by individuals. The available literature on human action detection includes various approaches to detect abnormal crowd behavior, which is articulated as an outlier detection problem. This paper presents a detailed review of the recent development of anomaly detection methods from the perspectives of computer vision on different available datasets. A new taxonomic organization of existing works in crowd analysis and anomaly detection has been introduced. A summarization of existing reviews and datasets related to anomaly detection has been listed. It covers an overview of different crowd concepts, including mass gathering events analysis and challenges, types of anomalies, and surveillance systems. Additionally, research trends and future work prospects have been analyzed.",

        "abstract": "This review study in on routing protocols of BeeAdHoc, AntHocNet and Moth-Ant inspired routing is based on the nature inspired schemes and leads to wild life behavior of Hill Myna and Desert Sparrow Optimization comparative to other biological algorithms. : Flying Ad Hoc Network (FANET) is a revolutionary achievement in the class of ad hoc networks to access areas near calamities. The concept of pilot free system takes place in technological advancement and computations. Networking advancements introduces Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) while the device that makes this system applicable is known as flying drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Single UAV may be employed as individual system, but it is more useful when UAVs in a network cooperate with each other. UAV deployments are rapid and pliant that reduces the tradition ad hoc network limitations. UAV have small operating structure and efficient energy life. Advance flight control mechanism makes FANETs differ from traditional ad hoc networks. FANETs can visualized to play key role where humans are in danger or rescue tasks are too dull or dirty. Improving the performance of flying drones leads to ease-of-use for formation of network, high stability and fast deployment. Routing and cooperative task allocation of nodes is complex in ad hoc networks. In contrast of the study of traditional schemes, our paper is based on the nature inspired schemes. This review study in on routing protocols of BeeAdHoc, AntHocNet and Moth-Ant inspired routing. In addition, the overview leads to wild life behavior of Hill Myna and Desert Sparrow Optimization comparative to other biological algorithms is presented in terms of task allocation and rendezvous cooperatively. Biological inspired behaviors trend to know the efficient problem solutions for FANETs.",

        "abstract": "To understand the future potential of IAs, one must first have a sufficiently concise view of the past and present efforts, i.e., understand their early applications and current directions. Industrial agents (IAs) [1] are multiagentbased systems (MASs) [2] that, for many years, have been advocated as a promising and realistic solution for an emerging set of industrial challenges. In the past, MASs fell into the scope of enterprise agility [3]-[8], and now, more than ever, pertain to the industrial digital transformation and sustainability spheres. MAS technology is being applied to several industrial applications in the cyber-physical system (CPS) context, namely, in smart production, smart electric grids, smart logistics, and smart health care [9]. To understand the future potential of IAs, one must first have a sufficiently concise view of the past and present efforts, i.e., understand their early applications and current directions. Such a view is necessary because, over the last decades, the concept of the IA has proven to be a bit of a moving target, adjusting to the needs, visions, and technologies of each era.",

        "abstract": "A new double rank-based task sequencing method is proposed and integrated with a multi-objective heuristic algorithm for multi-workflow scheduling that is capable of generating efficient schedules with high quality in terms of meeting multi-Objective for multiple workflows. Workflow scheduling in clouds has been extensively researched. Many workflows from different users could be submitted to clouds at the same time and cloud providers should handle them simultaneously. So, it is necessary to consider the problem of scheduling multi-workflow. In addition, cloud computing systems can offer some special features, like Pay-Per-Use and Quality of Service (QoS) over the Internet. The scheduler has to consider the tradeoffs between different QoS parameters in order to satisfy the QoS requirements. Hence, how to schedule multiple heterogeneous workflows in the meanwhile to balance multiple objectives is a big challenge. The majority of the existing multi-workflow scheduling algorithms are based on QoS constrained approaches and attempt to optimize one objective while taking other QoS factors as constraints. Meanwhile, most of the multi-objective optimization scheduling works aim to deal with single-workflow. Conversely, this paper focuses on QoS optimization approaches by finding trade-off schedules to execute multi-workflow on cloud computing resources so as to balance multi-objective. To this end, a new double rank-based task sequencing method is proposed and integrated with a multi-objective heuristic algorithm for multi-workflow scheduling. Different algorithms are evaluated using various well-known real-world workflows and simulated workflows. The performance evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of generating efficient schedules with high quality in terms of meeting multi-objective for multiple workflows.",

This paper establishes an off-policy integral reinforcement learning (IRL) method to solve nonlinear continuous-time (CT) nonzero-sum (NZS) games with unknown system dynamics. The IRL algorithm is presented to obtain the iterative control and off-policy learning is used to allow the dynamics to be completely unknown. Off-policy IRL is designed to do policy evaluation and policy improvement in the policy iteration algorithm. Critic and action networks are used to obtain the performance index and control for each player. The gradient descent algorithm makes the update of critic and action weights simultaneously. The convergence analysis of the weights is given. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system and the existence of Nash equilibrium are proved. The simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the developed method for nonlinear CT NZS games with unknown system dynamics.",

        "abstract": "A tunable algorithm for distributed outlier detection in dynamic mixed-attribute data sets that are prone to concept drift and models of the data must be dynamic as well is presented. Efficiently detecting outliers or anomalies is an important problem in many areas of science, medicine and information technology. Applications range from data cleaning to clinical diagnosis, from detecting anomalous defects in materials to fraud and intrusion detection. Over the past decade, researchers in data mining and statistics have addressed the problem of outlier detection using both parametric and non-parametric approaches in a centralized setting. However, there are still several challenges that must be addressed. First, most approaches to date have focused on detecting outliers in a continuous attribute space. However, almost all real-world data sets contain a mixture of categorical and continuous attributes. Categorical attributes are typically ignored or incorrectly modeled by existing approaches, resulting in a significant loss of information. Second, there have not been any general-purpose distributed outlier detection algorithms. Most distributed detection algorithms are designed with a specific domain (e.g. sensor networks) in mind. Third, the data sets being analyzed may be streaming or otherwise dynamic in nature. Such data sets are prone to concept drift, and models of the data must be dynamic as well. To address these challenges, we present a tunable algorithm for distributed outlier detection in dynamic mixed-attribute data sets.",

        "abstract": "An overview of the process of modeling human dispersals should arm any nonmodeler with enough understanding to evaluate the quality, strengths, and weaknesses of any particular archaeological simulation and provide a starting point for further exploration of this common scientific tool. abstract With the current surge of simulation studies in archaeology, there is a growing concern for the lack of engagement and feedback between modelers and domain specialists. To facilitate this dialogue, I present a compact guide to the simulation modeling process applied to a common research topic and the focus of this special issue of Human Biology\u2014human dispersals. The process of developing a simulation is divided into nine steps grouped in three phases. The conceptual phase consists of identifying research questions (step 1), finding the most suitable method (step 2), designing the general framework and the resolution of the simulation (step 3), and filling in that framework with the modeled entities and the rules of interactions (step 4). This is followed by the technical phase of coding and testing (step 5), parameterizing the simulation (step 6), and running it (step 7), and the results of the simulation are analyzed and recontextualized (step 8). In the dissemination phase, the findings of the model are disseminated in publications and code repositories (step 9). Each step is defined and characterized and then illustrated with examples of published human dispersal simulation studies. While not aiming to be a comprehensive textbook-style guide to simulation, this overview of the process of modeling human dispersals should arm any nonmodeler with enough understanding to evaluate the quality, strengths, and weaknesses of any particular archaeological simulation and provide a starting point for further exploration of this common scientific tool.",

        "abstract": "A Skip connected and Memory Guided Network (SMGNet) for video anomaly detection and the effect of augmenting memory guided network with skip connection in the residual spatiotemporal autoencoder (R-STAE) architecture is evaluated. Real-time video anomaly detection and localization still prevail as a challenging task. Autoencoders are expected to give high reconstruction error for abnormal events than normal events while trained on video segments of normal events. Nevertheless, this assumption is not always true in practice. Sometimes the autoencoder offers better generalization. Therefore, it also reconstructs abnormal events well, leading to slightly degraded performance for anomaly detection. To alleviate this issue, we propose a Skip connected and Memory Guided Network (SMGNet) for video anomaly detection. The memory guided network with skip connection help in avoiding loss of meaningful information such as foreground patterns, in addition to memorizing significant normality patterns. The effect of augmenting memory guided network with skip connection in the residual spatiotemporal autoencoder (R-STAE) architecture is evaluated. The proposed technique achieved improved results over three benchmark datasets.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, three key components, Adaptive Online Incremental Anchor Mining Strategy, Selective Scale Enhancement Strategy and Hierarchical Context-Aware Module are separately proposed to boost the performance of face detectors. Benefiting from the pioneering design of generic object detectors, significant achievements have been made in the field of face detection. Typically, the architectures of the backbone, feature pyramid layer, and detection head module within the face detector all assimilate the excellent experience from general object detectors. However, several effective methods, including label assignment and scale-level data augmentation strategy, fail to maintain consistent superiority when applying on the face detector directly. Concretely, the former strategy involves a vast body of hyperparameters and the latter one suffers from the challenge of scale distribution bias between different detection tasks, which both limit their generalization abilities. Furthermore, in order to provide accurate face bounding boxes for facial down-stream tasks, the face detector imperatively requires the elimination of false alarms. As a result, practical solutions on label assignment, scale-level data augmentation, and reducing false alarms are necessary for advancing face detectors. In this paper, we focus on resolving three aforementioned challenges that exiting methods are difficult to finish off and present a novel face detector, termed MogFace. In our Mogface, three key components, Adaptive Online Incremental Anchor Mining Strategy, Selective Scale Enhancement Strategy and Hierarchical Context-Aware Module, are separately proposed to boost the performance of face detectors. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, our MogFace is the best face detector on the Wider Face leader-board, achieving all champions across different testing scenarios.

        "abstract": "Satellite-based visible and near-infrared imaging of the Earth\u2019s surface is generally not performed in moderate to highly cloudy conditions; images that look visibly cloud covered to the human eye are typically discarded. Here, we expand upon previous work that employed machine learning (ML) to estimate underlying land surface reflectances at red, green, and blue (RGB) wavelengths in cloud contaminated spectra using a low spatial resolution satellite spectrometer. Specifically, we apply the ML methodology to a case study at much higher spatial resolution with the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) that flew on the International Space Station (ISS). HICO spatial sampling is of the order of 90 m. The purpose of our case study is to test whether high spatial resolution features can be captured using hyper-spectral imaging in lightly cloudy and overcast conditions. We selected one clear and one cloudy image over a portion of the panhandle coastline of Florida to demonstrate that land features are partially recoverable in overcast conditions. Many high contrast features are well recovered in the presence of optically thin clouds. However, some of the low contrast features, such as narrow roads, are smeared out in the heavily clouded part of the reconstructed image. This case study demonstrates that our approach may be useful for many science and operational applications that are being developed for current and upcoming satellite missions including precision agriculture and natural vegetation analysis, water quality assessment, as well as disturbance, change, hazard, and disaster detection.",

        "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of applications of international quality assurance certification at farm level on the implementation of traceability along the shrimp supply chain with evidence of linkages between quality assurance and traceability in the supply chain. ABSTRACT This study investigated the effects of applications of international quality assurance certification at farm level on the implementation of traceability along the shrimp supply chain with evidence from Vietnam. Descriptive statistics was explored to compare products, information flows, financial efficiency, and willingness to implement traceability between certified and noncertified quality assurance shrimp farms. A binary logistics model was applied to examine the effects of applications of international quality assurance certification and other factors on the willingness to implement traceability of shrimp farmers. Found results showed that the applications of international quality assurance certification of shrimp farmers supported traceability of shrimp products among stakeholders in the supply chain. The certified farmers indicated a higher willingness to implement traceability. However, the profitability of those applications for shrimp farmers was not statistically found. The economics incentives, including farm-gate price differentiation and minimization of production costs, should be carefully considered.",

        "abstract": "A novel tree topology based anomaly detection (TTAD) method for hyperspectral images (HSIs) that makes full use of the \u201cfew and different\u201d characteristics of anomalous data points that are sparsely distributed and far away from high-density populations is proposed. As one of the most important research and application directions in hyperspectral remote sensing, anomaly detection (AD) aims to locate objects of interest within a specific scene by exploiting spectral feature differences between different types of land cover without any prior information. Most traditional AD algorithms are model-driven and describe hyperspectral data with specific assumptions, which cannot combat the distributional complexity of land covers in real scenes, resulting in a decrease in detection performance. To overcome the limitations of traditional algorithms, a novel tree topology based anomaly detection (TTAD) method for hyperspectral images (HSIs) is proposed in this article. TTAD departs from the single analytical mode based on specific assumptions but directly parses the HSI data itself. It makes full use of the \u201cfew and different\u201d characteristics of anomalous data points that are sparsely distributed and far away from high-density populations. On this basis, topology, a powerful tool in mathematics that successfully handle multiple types of data mining tasks, is applied to AD to ensure sufficient feature extraction of land covers. First, the redistribution of HSI data is realized by constructing a tree-type topological space to improve the separability between anomalies and backgrounds. Then, topologically related subsets in this space are utilized to evaluate the abnormality degree of each sample in a dataset, and detection results for the HSI are output accordingly. Abandoning traditional modeling but focusing on mining the data characteristics of HSI itself enables TTAD to better adapt to different complex scenes and locate anomalies with high precision. Experimental results on a large number of benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTAD could achieve excellent detection results with considerable computational efficiency. The proposed method exhibits superior comprehensive performance and is promising to be popularized in practical applications.",

In this paper, we present a patch-based land use and land cover classification approach using Sentinel-2 satellite images. The Sentinel-2 satellite images are openly and freely accessible, and are provided in the earth observation program Copernicus. We present a novel dataset, based on these images that covers 13 spectral bands and is comprised of ten classes with a total of 27\u2009000 labeled and geo-referenced images. Benchmarks are provided for this novel dataset with its spectral bands using state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks. An overall classification accuracy of 98.57% was achieved with the proposed novel dataset. The resulting classification system opens a gate toward a number of earth observation applications. We demonstrate how this classification system can be used for detecting land use and land cover changes, and how it can assist in improving geographical maps.

        "abstract": "This work shows that compressed sensing reconstruction algorithms can greatly benefit from an overlapping sliding window reconstruction, and proposes a local joint sparse deconvolution and extrapolation (L-JSDE) to reconstruct images from arbitrary local measurements. In the framework of compressed sensing, image data is measured using less measurements than the total number of pixels. Each measurement consists of a (random) linear combination of all pixels. Since image data is approximately sparse in an appropriate transform domain, a reasonable reconstruction is possible for many measurement matrices, especially for i.i.d. Gaussian measurement matrices. In a seemingly different field, non-regular sampling techniques such as three-quarter sampling have shown promising results to enhance the resolution of an imaging sensor by effectively sub-sampling a higher resolution image. Here, the measurements can be described as linear combinations of only three pixels, which can also be seen as a (spectral) compressed sensing measurement. Since each measurement is spatially localized, the reconstruction can be performed in overlapping sliding windows. In this work, we show that compressed sensing reconstruction algorithms can greatly benefit from such an overlapping sliding window reconstruction. Compared to conventional block-wise compressed sensing with i.i.d. Gaussian measurement matrices, the reconstruction quality in terms of the PSNR increases up to +5dB using small, local i.d.d. Gaussian measurement blocks. Additionally, we propose a local joint sparse deconvolution and extrapolation (L-JSDE) to reconstruct images from arbitrary local measurements. For several applications with local measurements we show that L-JSDE increases the PSNR by +2.2dB relative to conventional block-wise i.i.d. Gaussian measurements reconstructed with the state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithm D-AMP using the same overall sampling density.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to use Random forest algorithm for classification of 29 plant species which are naturally occurring and readily available in India for their medicinal purpose and chooses the most accurate model. Ayurveda, the traditional medicinal system of India, suggests using various plant parts such as leaves, roots, fruits, and stems to cure a variety of ailments. Indian plants and herbs have been studied for their potential as medicines by numerous academics in the west. Due to this the recognition of these plants has become a focus of ongoing research. For the goal of classification and identification, this research employs an appropriate machine learning approach. Several machine learning approaches have been employed for this purpose over the year. The three phases of the suggested methodology are preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. The preprocessing phase includes standard image processing operations including gray scale conversion and border improvement. In feature extraction the phase gaps were closed using Closing operation of Morphological Transformation and the extraction of 15 features that were used for classification. In this study we aim to use Random forest algorithm for classification of 29 plant species which are naturally occurring and readily available in India for their medicinal purpose. During the course of this paper we chose to select the most accurate model, by conducting a comparative study for classification by implementing SVM, KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifier algorithms which gave 85%, 73%, 85% and 87% accuracy respectively.",

        "abstract": "A novel detail extraction model is first built by exploring the local relationship between HRMS and source images, thereby improving the accuracy of details and the interpretability of the network, and a lightweight network based on adaptive weighted feature learning network (AWFLN) is proposed for pansharpening. Deep learning (DL)-based pansharpening methods have shown great advantages in extracting spectral\u2013spatial features from multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images compared with traditional methods. However, most DL-based methods ignore the local inner connection between the source images and the high-resolution MS (HRMS) image, which cannot fully extract spectral\u2013spatial information and attempt to improve the quality of fusion by increasing the complexity of the network. To solve these problems, a lightweight network based on adaptive weighted feature learning network (AWFLN) is proposed for pansharpening. Specifically, a novel detail extraction model is first built by exploring the local relationship between HRMS and source images, thereby improving the accuracy of details and the interpretability of the network. Guided by this model, we then design a residual multiple receptive-field structure to fully extract spectral\u2013spatial features of source images. In this structure, an adaptive feature learning block based on spectral\u2013spatial interleaving attention is proposed to adaptively learn the weights of features and improve the accuracy of the extracted details. Finally, the pansharpened result is obtained by a detail injection model in AWFLN. Numerous experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared to traditional and state-of-the-art methods, AWFLN performs the best both subjectively and objectively, with high efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/yotick/AWFLN.",

        "abstract": "Comparative results reveal that the proposed RSA-based model obtained better results in de-noising and effectively segmenting the eight images. Due to the low energy attenuation of an acoustic wave in water, the side-scan sonar imaging technique is popularly used for underwater exploration. The images collected in this process contain a high amount of noise, which poses a challenge to accurately detecting underwater objects. In this paper, the de-noising of such images is carried out through a non-local means filtering algorithm. The obtained denoised images are further segmented to effectively determine the object, shadow, and background. The segmentation task is formulated as a clustering problem, and a recently reported nature-inspired algorithm known as Reptile Search Algorithm (RSA) is used. The RSA is based on the hunting behavior of crocodiles in a specific region. The Davies-Bouldin index is used as the fitness function to perform the clustering. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on four plane and four-ship images collected from the benchmark KLSG-II dataset. The obtained results are compared with the image segmentation performed by particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. Comparative results reveal that the proposed RSA-based model obtained better results in de-noising and effectively segmenting the eight images.",

        "abstract": "Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed band selection method is superior to other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of band subsets that achieve higher classification accuracy. ABSTRACT Hyperspectral image (HSI) has become one of the most important remote sensing techniques for object interpretation by its abundant band information. As the data dimension increases, band selection technique is utilized to achieve the highest possible classification accuracy with fewer bands. Essentially, it is considered as an NP-hard problem, which is a non-deterministic problem within polynomial complexity and difficult to achieve a satisfactory solution using traditional search methods. Sine cosine algorithm (SCA) is a recently developed swarm intelligence algorithm based on the calculation of sine and cosine functions. To determine the parameters setting in SCA, L\u00e9vy flight technique is employed to improve the exploitation phase of the algorithm. In the paper, a new band selection method on the basis of SCA with a L\u00e9vy flight is proposed, and an alternative distribution is utilized to decrease the band dimension of HSI. In addition, crossover operation is conducted to enhance the optimal bits of each individual, and an evaluation criterion for assessing the performance of band selection is defined, allowing the classification accuracy and selected number of bands to be as balanced as possible. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed band selection method is superior to other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of band subsets that achieve higher classification accuracy.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses various automatic and real-time surveillance methods for abnormal event detection to recognize the dynamic crowd behavior in security applications and broadly classified methods into different categories such as tracking, classification based on handcrafted extracted features, classificationbased on deep learning, and hybrid approaches. Fast and automated recognizing of abnormal behaviors in crowded scenes is significantly effective in increasing public security. The traditional procedure of recognizing abnormalities in the Web of Thing (WoT) platform comprises monitoring the activities and describing the crowd properties such as density, trajectory, and motion pattern from the visual frames. Accordingly, incorporating real-time security monitoring based on the WoT platform and machine learning algorithms would significantly enhance the influential detection of abnormal behaviors in the crowds. This paper addresses various automatic and real-time surveillance methods for abnormal event detection to recognize the dynamic crowd behavior in security applications. The critical aspect of security and protection of public places is that we cannot manually monitor the unpredictable and complex crowded environments. The abnormal behavior algorithms have attempted to improve efficiency, robustness against pixel occlusion, generalizability, computational complexity, and execution time. Similar to the state-of-the-art abnormal behavior detection of crowded scenes, we broadly classified methods into different categories such as tracking, classification based on handcrafted extracted features, classification based on deep learning, and hybrid approaches. Hybrid and deep learning methods have been found to have more satisfactory results in the classification stage. A set of video frames called Motion Emotion Dataset (MED) is employed in this study to examine the various conditions governing these methods. Incorporating an appropriate real-time approach with considering WoT platform can facilitate the analysis of crowd and individuals\u2019 behavior for security screening of abnormal events.",

A flying ad hoc network (FANET) that consists of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a promising technology for future networked systems. In this paper, we study a way to construct a topology for the FANET that guarantees end-to-end communication between the ground control station (GCS) and each mission UAV that performs its given task via optimizing the locations of the relay UAVs. To this end, we propose a topology construction algorithm based on a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.

        "abstract": "Some applications of multi-agent systems in steel sector are presented to show the advantages and opportunities of agent-based technology. A multi-agent system consists of several computational entities capable of autonomous actions, called agents, which communicate with each other, and have the ability to coordinate their actions and to cooperate. Multi-agent systems received a great interest and attention over time, as they can be seen as a key enabling technology for complex applications, where distributed and processing of data, autonomy, and high degree of interactions in dynamic environments are required at the same time. Therefore, in view of current and future developments of the digitalization of industrial production cycles promoted by Industry 4.0, multi-agent systems are foreseen to play an increasing role for industrial production management and optimization. Because of barriers represented by large presence of legacy systems, in the steel sector agent-based technology is not widely applied yet, and multi-agent systems applications are very few. On the other hand, steel manufacturing industries are complex and dynamic systems whose production processes held a strategic role in the global economy. During last decades, the steel sector has undergone relevant transformations, especially through the massive digitalization and the innovation introduced by Industry 4.0. A further evolution is foreseen in the incoming years to improve the sustainability of the production cycle by improving energy and resource efficiency. Therefore, steel industries must face several challenges on the path toward the factory of the future. In such context multi-agent systems, through their intrinsic properties, such as autonomy, social abilities, reactivity, proactivity, and mobility, can overcome existing drawbacks and barriers, by increasing flexibility, improving resources efficiency, handling production operations, reacting to unpredicted events, optimizing production processes, and supporting legacy systems. In this paper, some applications of multi-agent systems in steel sector are presented to show the advantages and opportunities of agent-based technology.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm to schedule large-scale workflows with various QoS parameters and designs seven new heuristics for the ACO approach and proposes an adaptive scheme that allows artificial ants to select heuristic based on pheromone values. Grid computing is increasingly considered as a promising next-generation computational platform that supports wide-area parallel and distributed computing. In grid environments, applications are always regarded as workflows. The problem of scheduling workflows in terms of certain quality of service (QoS) requirements is challenging and it significantly influences the performance of grids. By now, there have been some algorithms for grid workflow scheduling, but most of them can only tackle the problems with a single QoS parameter or with small-scale workflows. In this frame, this paper aims at proposing an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm to schedule large-scale workflows with various QoS parameters. This algorithm enables users to specify their QoS preferences as well as define the minimum QoS thresholds for a certain application. The objective of this algorithm is to find a solution that meets all QoS constraints and optimizes the user-preferred QoS parameter. Based on the characteristics of workflow scheduling, we design seven new heuristics for the ACO approach and propose an adaptive scheme that allows artificial ants to select heuristics based on pheromone values. Experiments are done in ten workflow applications with at most 120 tasks, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

This paper studies a multi-player H\u221e differential game for systems of general linear dynamics. In this game, multiple players design their control inputs to minimize their cost functions in the presence of worst-case disturbances. We first derive the optimal control and disturbance policies using the solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equations. We then prove that the derived optimal policies stabilize the system and constitute a Nash equilibrium solution. Two integral reinforcement learning (IRL) -based algorithms, including the policy iteration IRL and off-policy IRL, are developed to solve the differential game online. We show that the off-policy IRL can solve the multi-player H\u221e differential game online without using any system dynamics information. Simulation studies are conducted to validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed learning algorithms.",

Outliers are dissimilar or inconsistent data objects with respect to the remaining data objects in the data set or which are far away from their cluster centroids. Detecting outliers in data is a very important concept in Knowledge Data Discovery process for finding hidden knowledge. The task of detecting the outliers has been studied in a large number of research areas like Financial Data Analysis, Large Distributed Systems, Biological Data Analysis, Data Mining, Scientific Applications, Health monitoring, etc., Existing research study of outlier detection shows that Density Based outlier detection techniques are robust. Identifying outliers in a distributed environment is not a simple task because processing with a distributed database raises two major issues. First one is rendering massive data which are generated from different databases. And the second is data integration, which may cause data security violation and sensitive information leakage. Handling distributed database is a difficult task. In this paper, we present a cluster based outliers detection to spot outliers in large and vibrant (updated dynamically) distributed database in which cell density based centralized detection is used to succeed in dealing with massive data rendering problem and data integration problem. Experiments are conducted on various datasets and the obtained results clearly shows the robustness of the proposed technique for finding outliers in large distributed database.",

        "abstract": "The development, floruit and decline of the urban phase of the Indus Civilisation (c.2600/2500-1900 BC) provide an ideal opportunity to investigate social resilience and transformation in relation to a variable climate. The Indus Civilisation extended over most of the Indus River Basin, which includes a mix of diverse environments conditioned, among other factors, by partially overlapping patterns of winter and summer precipitation. These patterns likely changed towards the end of the urban phase (4.2 ka BP event), increasing aridity. The impact of this change appears to have varied at different cities and between urban and rural contexts. We present a simulation approach using agent-based modelling to address the potential diversity of agricultural strategies adopted by Indus settlements in different socio-ecological scenarios in Haryana, NW India. This is an ongoing initiative that consists of creating a modular model, Indus Village, that assesses the implications of trends in cropping strategies for the sustainability of settlements and the resilience of such strategies under different regimes of precipitation. The model aims to simulate rural settlements structured into farming households, with sub-models representing weather and land systems, food economy, demography, and land use. This model building is being carried out as part of the multi-disciplinary TwoRains project. It brings together research on material culture, settlement distribution, food production and consumption, vegetation and paleoenvironmental conditions.",

Time-efficient anomaly detection and localization in video surveillance still remains challenging due to the complexity of \u201canomaly\u201d. In this paper, we propose a cuboid-patch-based method characterized by a cascade of classifiers called a spatial-temporal cascade autoencoder (ST-CaAE), which makes full use of both spatial and temporal cues from video data. The ST-CaAE has two main stages, defined by two proposed neural networks: a spatial-temporal adversarial autoencoder (ST-AAE) and a spatial-temporal convolutional autoencoder (ST-CAE). First, the ST-AAE is used to preliminarily identify anomalous video cuboids and exclude normal cuboids. The key idea underlying ST-AAE is to obtain a Gaussian model to fit the distribution of the regular data. Then in the second stage, the ST-CAE classifies the specific abnormal patches in each anomalous cuboid with reconstruction error based strategy that takes advantage of the CAE and skip connection. A two-stream framework is utilized to fuse the appearance and motion cues to achieve more complete detection results, taking the gradient and optical flow cuboids as inputs for each stream. The proposed ST-CaAE is evaluated using three public datasets. The experimental results verify that our framework outperforms other state-of-the-art works.",

        "abstract": "Extensive experiments show that the embedded image super-resolution module can significantly improve the detection accuracy at the cost of a small amount of additional parameters and computational overhead, while helping the model achieve competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-arts methods. In face detection, low-resolution faces, such as numerous small faces of a human group in a crowded scene, are common in dense face prediction tasks. They usually contain limited visual clues and make small faces less distinguishable from the other small objects, which poses great challenge to accurate face detection. Although deep convolutional neural network has significantly promoted the research on face detection recently, current deep face detectors rarely take into account low-resolution faces and are still vulnerable to the real-world scenarios where massive amount of low-resolution faces exist. Consequently, they usually achieve degraded performance for low-resolution face detection. In order to alleviate this problem, we develop an efficient detector termed EfficientSRFace by introducing a feature-level super-resolution reconstruction network for enhancing the feature representation capability of the model. This module plays an auxiliary role in the training process, and can be removed during the inference without increasing the inference time. Extensive experiments on public benchmarking datasets, such as FDDB and WIDER Face, show that the embedded image super-resolution module can significantly improve the detection accuracy at the cost of a small amount of additional parameters and computational overhead, while helping our model achieve competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-arts methods.",

        "abstract": "Retrievals of ocean color from space are important for better understanding of the ocean ecosystem but can be limited under conditions such as clouds, aerosols, and sunglint. Many ocean color algorithms use a few selected spectral bands to perform an atmospheric correction and then derive the upwelling radiance from the ocean. The limitations in the atmospheric correction under certain conditions lead to many gaps in daily spatial coverage of ocean color retrievals. To address these limitations, we introduce a new approach that uses machine learning to estimate ocean color from top of atmosphere radiances or reflectance measurements. In this approach, a principal component analysis is used to decompose the hyperspectral measurements into spectral features that describe the scattering and absorption of the atmosphere and the underlying surface. The coefficients of the principal components are then used to train a neural network to predict ocean color properties derived from the MODIS atmospheric correction algorithm. This machine learning approach is independent of a priori information and does not rely on any radiative transfer modeling. We apply the approach to two hyperspectral UV/VIS instruments, the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), using measurements from 320\u2013500 nm to show that it can be used to reproduce ocean color properties in less-than-ideal conditions. This machine learning approach complements the current atmospheric correction ocean color retrievals by filling in the gaps resulting from cloud, aerosol, and sunglint contamination. This method can be applied to the future hyperspectral Ocean Color Instrument (OCI), which will be onboard NASA\u2019s Plankton, Aerosol Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) ocean color satellite set to launch in 2024.",

        "abstract": "Traceability is considered the most important requirement for shrimp products exported to global markets. However, implementing traceability in shrimp-exporting countries is challenging because of limited production at the local supply chain and lack of financial welfare awareness. This study aims to investigate the expected farm-gate price for traceability implementation using a double-bound dichotomous choice experiment. The censored regression model is used to estimate the factors influencing the anticipated farm-gate price of shrimp farmers. The survey was conducted in Ca Mau Province, Vietnam, by interviewing 71 Penaeus monodon Fabricius, 1798, and 43 Penaeus vannamei Boone, 1931, farmers. To implement traceability, P. monodon farmers estimated the farm-gate price at 10.17 USD.kg-1 , while P. vannamei farmers expected 6.18 USD.kg-1 . Application of international quality assurance certifications, willingness to implement traceability, land used, culture methods, shrimp species, current farm-gate price, and variable costs affected the expected farm-gate price. The attractive anticipated farm-gate price compensated for the negative influence of applying international quality assurance certifications, indicating that the farmers were willing to implement traceability. This suggests that the application of certifications increased the ability to implement traceability in the shrimp supply chain. The attractive farm-gate price for certified shrimp products would enhance their willingness to implement the traceability of shrimp products.",

Finger-vein biometric identification has gained attention recently due to its several advantages over fingerprint \nbiometric traits. Finger-vein recognition is a method of biometric authentication that applies pattern recognition techniques based on the image of human finger-vein patterns. This paper is focused on developing a MATLAB-based finger-vein recognition system using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Graphical User Interface (GUI) as the user input. Two layers of CNN out of the proposed four-layer CNN have been used to retrain the network for new incoming subjects. The pre-processing steps for finger-vein images and CNN design have been conducted pm different platforms. Therefore, this paper discusses the method of linking both parts from different platforms using MEX-files in MATLAB. Evaluation is carried out using images of 50 subjects that are developed in-house. An accuracy of an average of 96% is obtained to recognize 1 to 10 new subjects within less than 10 seconds.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a novel binning concept using tetromino-shaped pixels that achieves superior image quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and visually compared to conventional single-image super- resolution using the very deep super-resolution (VDSR) network. For modern high-resolution imaging sensors, pixel binning is performed in low-lighting conditions and in case high frame rates are required. To recover the original spatial resolution, single-image super-resolution techniques can be applied for upscaling. To achieve a higher image quality after upscaling, we propose a novel binning concept using tetromino-shaped pixels. It is embedded into the field of compressed sensing and the coherence is calculated to motivate the sensor layouts used. Next, we investigate the reconstruction quality using tetromino pixels for the first time in literature. Instead of using different types of tetrominoes as proposed elsewhere, we show that using a small repeating cell consisting of only four T-tetrominoes is sufficient. For reconstruction, we use a locally fully connected reconstruction (LFCR) network as well as two classical reconstruction methods from the field of compressed sensing. Using the LFCR network in combination with the proposed tetromino layout, we achieve superior image quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and visually compared to conventional single-image super-resolution using the very deep super-resolution (VDSR) network. For PSNR, a gain of up to \\SI[retain-explicit-plus]{+1.92}{dB} is achieved.",

This paper presents a method for identification and classification of images of medicinal plants such as herbs, shrubs and trees based on color and texture feature using SVM and neural network classifier. The tribal people in India classify plants according to their medicinal values. In the system of medicine called Ayurveda, identification of medicinal plants is considered an important activity in the preparation of herbal medicines. Ayurveda medicines have become alternate for allopathic medicine. Hence, leveraging technology in automatic identification and classification of medicinal plants has become essential. Plant species belonging to different classes such as Papaya, Neem, Tulasi, Aloe and Garlic are considered in this work. This paper presents edge and color descriptors that have low-dimension, effective and simple. In addition, the rotation invariant texture descriptors namely, directional difference and the gradient histogram are used. These features are obtained from 900 images of medicinal plants and used to train and test the image samples of three classes with SVM and radial basis exact fit neural network (RBENN). The classification accuracies for color, edge texture features are 74% and 80% respectively. The accuracy is improved to 90% with combined color and texture features. The results are encouraging for tree image plants than herbs and shrubs due to distinguishing feature of stem.",

        "abstract": "Pansharpening is an important technology for remote sensing imaging systems to obtain high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images. It mainly obtains HRMS images with uniform spectral distribution and rich spatial details by fusing low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images and high spatial resolution panchromatic (PAN) images. Therefore, how to extract features completely and reconstruct images with high quality is critical to obtain ideal fusion images. In this article, we propose a new pansharpening method, called the Cross-Attention-based Depth Unfolding Iteration network for pansharpening remote sensing images (CADUI), which achieves the desired fusion effect by iteratively optimizing the deep prior regularization and combining it with a cross-attention mechanism. The network consists of two parts: optimized iterations of deep prior regularization (DEIN-Block) and cross-attention mechanism (CAFM-Block). Among them, DEIN-Block introduces the depth prior as an implicit regularization and improves the adaptability and representation ability of the relevant data of the reconstructed image through iteration. CAFM-Block realizes dual-branch fusion through cross-attention fusion and channel-attention fusion to achieve better fusion results. Simulation experiments and real experiments are carried out on the standard datasets: QuickBird (QB) and WorldView-2 (WV2). Through quantitative comparison and qualitative analysis, it is proven that the method is superior to the existing methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an enhanced fuzzy-based with Kernel metric (EnFK) algorithm for the segmentation of sonar images which, in an attempt to improve segmentation accuracy, introduces two new fuzzy terms of local spatial and statistical information. The recent boost in undersea operations has led to the development of high-resolution sonar systems mounted on autonomous vehicles. These vehicles are used to scan the seafloor in search of different objects such as sunken ships, archaeological sites, and submerged mines. An important part of the detection operation is the segmentation of sonar images, where the object\u2019s highlight and shadow are distinguished from the seabed background. In this paper, we focus on the automatic segmentation of sonar images. We present our enhanced fuzzy-based with Kernel metric (EnFK) algorithm for the segmentation of sonar images which, in an attempt to improve segmentation accuracy, introduces two new fuzzy terms of local spatial and statistical information. Our algorithm includes a preliminary de-noising algorithm which, together with the original image, feeds into the segmentation procedure to avoid trapping to local minima and to improve convergence. The result is a segmentation procedure that specifically suits the intensity inhomogeneity and the complex seabed texture of sonar images. We tested our approach using simulated images, real sonar images, and sonar images that were created in two different sea experiments, using multibeam sonar and synthetic aperture sonar. The results show accurate segmentation performance that is far beyond the state-of-the-art results.",

        "title": "A Comparative Analysis of Swarm Intelligence and Evolutionary Algorithms for Feature Selection in SVM-Based Hyperspectral Image Classification",
        "abstract": "A new filter\u2013wrapper (F\u2013W) framework is proposed that can improve the SIEAs\u2019 performance and outperform other commonly used FS techniques in accuracy overall, especially in complex scenes. Feature selection (FS) is vital in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, it is an NP-hard problem, and Swarm Intelligence and Evolutionary Algorithms (SIEAs) have been proved effective in solving it. However, the high dimensionality of HSIs still leads to the inefficient operation of SIEAs. In addition, many SIEAs exist, but few studies have conducted a comparative analysis of them for HSI FS. Thus, our study has two goals: (1) to propose a new filter\u2013wrapper (F\u2013W) framework that can improve the SIEAs\u2019 performance; and (2) to apply ten SIEAs under the F\u2013W framework (F\u2013W\u2013SIEAs) to optimize the support vector machine (SVM) and compare their performance concerning five aspects, namely the accuracy, the number of selected bands, the convergence rate, and the relative runtime. Based on three HSIs (i.e., Indian Pines, Salinas, and Kennedy Space Center (KSC)), we demonstrate how the proposed framework helps improve these SIEAs\u2019 performances. The five aspects of the ten algorithms are different, but some have similar optimization capacities. On average, the F\u2013W\u2013Genetic Algorithm (F\u2013W\u2013GA) and F\u2013W\u2013Grey Wolf Optimizer (F\u2013W\u2013GWO) have the strongest optimization abilities, while the F\u2013W\u2013GWO requires the least runtime among the ten. The F\u2013W\u2013Marine Predators Algorithm (F\u2013W\u2013MPA) is second only to the two and slightly better than F\u2013W\u2013Differential Evolution (F\u2013W\u2013DE). The F\u2013W\u2013Ant Lion Optimizer (F\u2013W\u2013ALO), F\u2013W\u2013I-Ching Divination Evolutionary Algorithm (F\u2013W\u2013IDEA), and F\u2013W\u2013Whale Optimization Algorithm (F\u2013W\u2013WOA) have the middle optimization abilities, and F\u2013W\u2013IDEA takes the most runtime. Moreover, the F\u2013W\u2013SIEAs outperform other commonly used FS techniques in accuracy overall, especially in complex scenes.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a differentially private approach for training neural networks that employs a generalization of differential privacy called concentrated differential privacy (CDP), with both a formal and refined privacy loss analysis on two different data batching methods. Deep learning techniques based on neural networks have shown significant success in a wide range of AI tasks. Large-scale training datasets are one of the critical factors for their success. However, when the training datasets are crowdsourced from individuals and contain sensitive information, the model parameters may encode private information and bear the risks of privacy leakage. The recent growing trend of the sharing and publishing of pre-trained models further aggravates such privacy risks. To tackle this problem, we propose a differentially private approach for training neural networks. Our approach includes several new techniques for optimizing both privacy loss and model accuracy. We employ a generalization of differential privacy called concentrated differential privacy(CDP), with both a formal and refined privacy loss analysis on two different data batching methods. We implement a dynamic privacy budget allocator over the course of training to improve model accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively improves privacy loss accounting, training efficiency and model quality under a given privacy budget.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a real-time surveillance strategy for detecting anomalous behavior in crowds that is based on deep transfer learning and the Internet of Drones, and can be used to distinguish dynamic crowds. Intelligent identification of abnormal behaviors in crowd scenes enables far more efficient development of smart cities. In recent approaches, abnormalities are detected using an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) by observing activity and representing crowd features such as density, direction, and anomalous behavior from acquired video frames. Thus, integrating fast monitoring via an autonomous UAV with automated procedures would significantly improve the effectiveness of detecting abnormal activities. Our work presents a real-time surveillance strategy for detecting anomalous behavior in crowds that is based on deep transfer learning and the Internet of Drones,and can be used to distinguish dynamic crowds. The deep structure is a simplified and lightweight representation of the ResNet learning structure. The proposed model that detects the abnormal behavior in this study processes the data analyzed from UAVs and intendS to increase its efficiency, robust-ness, and accuracy. For several UAV videos, the average accuracy is more than 90 percent. The experimental results reveal that the suggested method robustly detects abnormal behaviors in crowd scenarios using frames from UAV recordings with demanding conditions.",

        "abstract": "An integrated topology management algorithm that contains the topology construction and adjustment algorithms is developed and achieves a good network performance with low computational overhead, which is one of the most essential virtues in FANETs with rapidly varying topology. Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) that consist of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are promising technologies for future networked systems due to the versatility of UAVs. One of the most distinguishing features of FANET is frequent and rapid topological fluctuations due to the high-mobility of UAVs. Hence, the topology management adapting to the movements of UAVs is one of the most critical issues in FANET. In this paper, we study a FANET topology management problem that optimizes the locations and movements of UAVs to maximize the network performance, adapting to the topological changes while UAVs carry out their missions. When formulating the problem, we take into account the routing protocol as an arbitrary function since the network performance is inseparably linked with the routing protocol in use. We first develop two algorithms. One is the topology construction algorithm, which constructs a FANET topology from the scratch without any given initial topology, based on particle swarm optimization. The other is the topology adjustment algorithm, which incrementally adjusts the FANET topology adapting to the movements of UAVs with low-computational costs, based on gradient descent. Then, by defining a logical distance (the so-called topology edit distance) that measures the degree of changes in FANET topology, we develop an integrated topology management algorithm that contains the topology construction and adjustment algorithms. The simulation results show that our algorithm achieves a good network performance with low computational overhead, which is one of the most essential virtues in FANETs with rapidly varying topology.",

        "abstract": "Legacy systems are valuable assets in most public sector agencies that have been in use for a long time. These systems support government service delivery to the citizens and maintain vital public administration functions and data. However, legacy systems are often related to technical difficulties that impede innovation efforts. The maintenance of the systems has become challenging and incompatible with the demands of digital transformation in the public sector. Due to their importance, the systems cannot be easily discarded. Rebuilding the old systems from scratch entails a long development timeline, high cost, and the loss of critical service functionalities. These circumstances encourage the public sector agencies to implement the modernisation of legacy systems. However, the modernisation effort for legacy systems in the public sector is not straightforward. Besides technical aspects, it should also consider non-technical aspects, including the requirements of the new era of citizen-centric digital government. In order to achieve this aspiration, a complete strategy must be developed to serve as a guide for government agencies. Hence, the purpose of this study is to develop a comprehensive guideline for the public sector. The research has been developed using a qualitative methodology that incorporates the theoretical and empirical phases. The theoretical phase was conducted through a literature review of previous studies related to the research topic. The empirical phase in the public sector was implemented and analysed using phenomenology and grounded theory methods. A total of 19 informants were involved in the individual and focus group interviews conducted. The study results revealed that human, process, product, and organisation aspects as well as the related characteristics of the citizen-centric influence the legacy systems modernisation in the era of digital government. The findings contribute as a complete guideline for the public sector agencies in modernising the legacy systems in line with the citizen-centric digital government vision.",

In this paper, we develop an integral reinforcement learning algorithm based on policy iteration to learn online the Nash equilibrium solution for a two-player zero-sum differential game with completely unknown linear continuous-time dynamics. This algorithm is a fully model-free method solving the game algebraic Riccati equation forward in time. The developed algorithm updates value function, control and disturbance policies simultaneously. The convergence of the algorithm is demonstrated to be equivalent to Newton's method. To implement this algorithm, one critic network and two action networks are used to approximate the game value function, control and disturbance policies, respectively, and the least squares method is used to estimate the unknown parameters. The effectiveness of the developed scheme is demonstrated in the simulation by designing an H\u221e state feedback controller for a power system.",

Traditional outlier detection algorithms are designed to apply to centralized databases, not distributed databases. We proposed a novel outlier detection algorithm for distributed databases. Given data assigned to different network nodes of a network platform, where each node has its own memory and hard disc, and the communication between nodes driven by message, the populated data would be non-overlapping. The working way of the network system is a manager-worker mode, that is, that a node as manager is responsible for assigning tasks to worker and querying the results from worker nodes. The algorithm first detected local outliers based on distance on all nodes, and then identified local outliers collected in the central node where a globally screening operation on all local outliers was implemented to achieve really global outliers. To scale the algorithm to massive data and reduce its computing complexity, a data filtering technology was further presented. Experimental results demonstrated that the algorithm effectively and efficiently handled on real and artificial data.",

        "abstract": "The start and end of the urban phase of the Indus civilization (IC; c. 2500 to 1900 BC) are often linked with climate change, specifically regarding trends in the intensity of summer and winter precipitation and its effect on the productivity of local food economies. The Indus Village is a modular agent-based model designed as a heuristic \u201csandbox\u201d to investigate how IC farmers could cope with diverse and changing environments and how climate change could impact the local and regional food production levels required for maintaining urban centers. The complete model includes dedicated submodels about weather, topography, soil properties, crop dynamics, food storage and exchange, nutrition, demography, and farming decision-making. In this paper, however, we focus on presenting the parts required for generating crop dynamics, including the submodels involved (weather, soil water, land, and crop models) and how they are combined progressively to form two integrated models (land water and land crop models). Furthermore, we describe and discuss the results of six simulation experiments, which highlight the roles of seasonality, topography, and crop diversity in understanding the potential impact of environmental variability, including climate change, in IC food economies. We conclude by discussing a broader consideration of risk and risk mitigation strategies in ancient agriculture and potential implications to the sustainability of the IC urban centres.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes spatial-temporal memories augmented two-stream auto-encoder framework, which learns the appearance normality and motion normal-ity independently and explores the correlations via adversar-ial learning. Video anomaly detection is a challenging task in the Computer vision community. Most single task-based methods do not consider the independence of unique spatial and temporal patterns, while two-stream structures lack the exploration of the correlations. In this paper, we propose spatial-temporal memories augmented two-stream auto-encoder framework, which learns the appearance normality and motion normal-ity independently and explores the correlations via adversar-ial learning. Specifically, we first design two proxy tasks to train the two-stream structure to extract appearance and motion features in isolation. Then, the prototypical features are recorded in the corresponding spatial and temporal memory pools. Finally, the encoding-decoding network performs ad-versariallearning with the discriminator to explore the corre-lations between spatial and temporal patterns. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, achieving AUCs of 98.1% and 89.8% on UCSD Ped2 and CUHK Avenue datasets.",

        "abstract": "An efficient deep face detector termed EfficientFace is designed, which contains three modules for feature enhancement and a novel cross-scale feature fusion strategy to facilitate bottom-up information propagation, such that fusing low-level and highlevel features is further strengthened. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have significantly advanced face detection. In particular, lightweight CNNbased architectures have achieved great success due to their lowcomplexity structure facilitating real-time detection tasks. However, current lightweight CNN-based face detectors trading accuracy for efficiency have inadequate capability in handling insufficient feature representation, faces with unbalanced aspect ratios and occlusion. Consequently, they exhibit deteriorated performance far lagging behind the deep heavy detectors. To achieve efficient face detection without sacrificing accuracy, we design an efficient deep face detector termed EfficientFace in this study, which contains three modules for feature enhancement. To begin with, we design a novel cross-scale feature fusion strategy to facilitate bottom-up information propagation, such that fusing low-level and highlevel features is further strengthened. Besides, this is conducive to estimating the locations of faces and enhancing the descriptive power of face features. Secondly, we introduce a Receptive Field Enhancement module to consider faces with various aspect ratios. Thirdly, we add an Attention Mechanism module for improving the representational capability of occluded faces. We have evaluated EfficientFace on four public benchmarks and experimental results demonstrate the appealing performance of our method. In particular, our model respectively achieves 95.1% (Easy), 94.0% (Medium) and 90.1% (Hard) on validation set of WIDER Face dataset, which is competitive with heavyweight models with only 1/15 computational costs of the state-of-the-art MogFace detector.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an important trace-gas pollutant and climate agent whose presence also leads to spectral interference in ocean color retrievals. NO2 column densities have been retrieved with satellite UV\u2013Vis spectrometers such as the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) that typically have spectral resolutions of the order of 0.5\u2009nm or better and spatial footprints as small as 3.6\u2009km\u2009\u00d7\u20095.6\u2009km. These NO2 observations are used to estimate emissions, monitor pollution trends, and study effects on human health. Here, we investigate whether it is possible to retrieve NO2 amounts with lower-spectral-resolution hyperspectral imagers such as the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) that will fly on the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite set for launch in early 2024. OCI will have a spectral resolution of 5\u2009nm and a spatial resolution of \u223c\u20091\u2009km with global coverage in 1\u20132\u2009d. At this spectral resolution, small-scale spectral structure from NO2 absorption is still present. We use real spectra from the OMI to simulate OCI spectra that are in turn used to estimate NO2 slant column densities (SCDs) with an artificial neural network (NN) trained on target OMI retrievals. While we obtain good results with no noise added to the OCI simulated spectra, we find that the expected instrumental noise substantially degrades the OCI NO2 retrievals. Nevertheless, the NO2 information from OCI may be of value for ocean color retrievals. OCI retrievals can also be temporally averaged over timescales of the order of months to reduce noise and provide higher-spatial-resolution maps that may be useful for downscaling lower-spatial-resolution data provided by instruments such as OMI and TROPOMI; this downscaling could potentially enable higher-resolution emissions estimates and be useful for other applications. In addition, we show that NNs that use coefficients of leading modes of a principal component analysis of radiance spectra as inputs appear to enable noise reduction in NO2 retrievals. Once trained, NNs can also substantially speed up NO2 spectral fitting algorithms as applied to OMI, TROPOMI, and similar instruments that are flying or will soon fly in geostationary orbit.\n",

        "abstract": "A pipeline for analyzing satellite images using a deep convolutional neural network for practical applications and achieves 86% classification accuracy on unseen raw images for land-cover classification of satellite images. Abstract. Currently, analyzing satellite images requires an unsustainable amount of manual labor. Semiautomatic solutions for land-cover classification of satellite images entail the incorporation of expert knowledge. To increase the scalability of the built solutions, methods that automate image processing and analysis pipelines are required. Recently, deep learning (DL) models have been applied to challenging vision problems with great success. We expect that the use of DL models will soon outperform shallow networks and other classification algorithms, as recently achieved in multiple domains. Here, we consider the task of land-cover classification of satellite images. This seems particularly appropriate for deep classifiers due to the combined high dimensionality of the data with the presence of compositional dependencies between pixels, which can be used to characterize a particular class. We develop a pipeline for analyzing satellite images using a deep convolutional neural network for practical applications. We present its successful application for land-cover classification, where it achieves 86% classification accuracy on unseen raw images.",

        "abstract": "A hybrid system of combining the effect of tree efficient models: Convolutional neural network (CNN), Softmax and Random forest (RF) classifier based on multi-biometric fingerprint, finger-vein and face identification system that can offer an accurate and efficient matching compared with other system based on unimodal, bimmodal, multimodal characteristics. In recent years, the need for security of personal data is becoming progressively important. In this regard, the identification system based on fusion of multibiometric is most recommended for significantly improving and achieving the high performance accuracy. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a hybrid system of combining the effect of tree efficient models: Convolutional neural network (CNN), Softmax and Random forest (RF) classifier based on multi-biometric fingerprint, finger-vein and face identification system. In conventional fingerprint system, image pre-processed is applied to separate the foreground and background region based on K-means and DBSCAN algorithm. Furthermore, the features are extracted using CNNs and dropout approach, after that, the Softmax performs as a recognizer. In conventional fingervein system, the region of interest image contrast enhancement using exposure fusion framework is input into the CNNs model. Moreover, the RF classifier is proposed for classification. In conventional face system, the CNNs architecture and Softmax are required to generate face feature vectors and classify personal recognition. The score provided by these systems is combined for improving Human identification. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on publicly available SDUMLA-HMT real multimodal biometric database using a GPU based implementation. Experimental results on the datasets has shown significant capability for identification biometric system. The proposed work can offer an accurate and efficient matching compared with other system based on unimodal, bimodal, multimodal characteristics.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this article is to introduce the concept of SR algorithms to readers who are unfamiliar with this area and to provide a review for experts to present the technical review of various existing SR methodologies which are often employed. A new approach toward increasing spatial resolution is required to overcome the limitations of the sensors and optics manufacturing technology. One promising approach is to use signal processing techniques to obtain an high-resolution (HR) image (or sequence) from observed multiple low-resolution (LR) images. Such a resolution enhancement approach has been one of the most active research areas, and it is called super resolution (SR) (or HR) image reconstruction or simply resolution enhancement. In this article, we use the term \"SR image reconstruction\" to refer to a signal processing approach toward resolution enhancement because the term \"super\" in \"super resolution\" represents very well the characteristics of the technique overcoming the inherent resolution limitation of LR imaging systems. The major advantage of the signal processing approach is that it may cost less and the existing LR imaging systems can be still utilized. The SR image reconstruction is proved to be useful in many practical cases where multiple frames of the same scene can be obtained, including medical imaging, satellite imaging, and video applications. The goal of this article is to introduce the concept of SR algorithms to readers who are unfamiliar with this area and to provide a review for experts. To this purpose, we present the technical review of various existing SR methodologies which are often employed. Before presenting the review of existing SR algorithms, we first model the LR image acquisition process.",

        "abstract": "A methodology for color and edge histogram based medicinal plants image retrieval and uses edge and edge direction histograms in the work to get edges in the stem and leafy parts. In this paper, we propose a methodology for color and edge histogram based medicinal plants image retrieval. The medicinal plants are divided into herbs, shrubs and trees. The medicinal plants are used in ayurvedic medicines. Manual identification of medicinal plants requires a priori knowledge. Automatic recognition of medicinal plants is useful. We have considered medicinal plant species, such as Papaya, Neem, Tulasi and Aloevera are considered for identification and retrieval. The color histograms are obtained in RGB, HSV and YCbCr color spaces. The number of valleys and peaks in the color histograms are used as features. But, these features alone are not helpful in discriminating plant images, since majority plant images are green in color. We have used edge and edge direction histograms in the work to get edges in the stem and leafy parts. Finally, these features are used in retrieval of medicinal plant images. Absolute distance, Euclidean distance and mean square error, similarity distance measures are deployed in the work. The results show an average retrieval efficiency of 94% and 98% for edge and edge direction features respectively.",

        "abstract": "An attention-guided multiscale context aggregation network (AMCA) for remote sensing image change detection using the fully attentional pyramid module (FAPM) and the dense feature fusion module (DFFM) to fully fuse the bitemporal features to obtain the change regions. Remote sensing image change detection is the key to understanding surface changes. Although the existing change detection methods have achieved good results, some structural details are missing and the detection accuracy needs to be improved. Therefore, we propose an attention-guided multiscale context aggregation network (AMCA) for remote sensing image change detection. First, we use the fully attentional pyramid module (FAPM) to enhance the deep feature information of the original image. And we introduce the dense feature fusion module (DFFM) to fully fuse the bitemporal features to obtain the change regions. Second, the introduction of channelwise cross fusion transformer (CCT) and channelwise cross attention (CCA) not only can effectively fuse channel features focusing on different semantic patterns but also bridge the semantic gap between multiscale features. Next, we use the transformer decoder to map the learned high-level semantic information into the pixel space to refine the original features. In addition, we use the context extraction module (CEM) to obtain the local and global associations of feature maps. Finally, the addition of an attention aggregation module (AAM) can effectively combine the feature information at different scales. Extensive experiments on three public change detection datasets show that the proposed method has advantages over other methods in terms of both visual interpretation and quantitative analysis.",

        "abstract": "This review is to make the researchers engaged in sonar image segmentation learn about the research works in the field in a short time and to describe main ideas, advantages, disadvantages, and conditions of use of every method. The sonar image segmentation is needed such as in underwater object orientation and recognition, in collision prevention and navigation of underwater robots, in underwater investigation and rescue, in seafloor object seeking, in seafloor salvage, and in marine military affairs like torpedo detection. The wavelet-based methods have the ability of multiscale and multiresolution, and they are apt at edge detection and feature extraction of images. The applications of these methods to the sonar image segmentation are increasingly raised. The contents of the article are to classify the sonar image segmentation methods with wavelets and to describe main ideas, advantages, disadvantages, and conditions of use of every method. In the methods for sonar image region (or texture) segmentation, the thought of multiscale (or multiresolution) analysis of the wavelet transform is usually combined with other theories or methods such as the clustering algorithms, the Markov random field, co-occurrence matrix, Bayesian theory, and support vector machine. In the methods for sonar image edge detection, the space\u2013frequency local characteristics of the wavelet transform are usually utilized. The wavelet packet-based and beyond wavelet-based methods can usually reach more precise segmentation. The article also gives 12 directions (or development trends predicted) of the sonar image segmentation methods with wavelets which should be researched deeply in the future. The aim of writing this review is to make the researchers engaged in sonar image segmentation learn about the research works in the field in a short time. Up to now, the similar reviews in this field have not been found.",

        "abstract": "Experimental results and statistical analyses validated the outstanding performance of SSAFS compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms, confirming the superiority of SsaFS in exploring the feature space and identifying the most valuable features for diseased plant image classification. Deep learning has been widely used for plant disease recognition in smart agriculture and has proven to be a powerful tool for image classification and pattern recognition. However, it has limited interpretability for deep features. With the transfer of expert knowledge, handcrafted features provide a new way for personalized diagnosis of plant diseases. However, irrelevant and redundant features lead to high dimensionality. In this study, we proposed a swarm intelligence algorithm for feature selection [salp swarm algorithm for feature selection (SSAFS)] in image-based plant disease detection. SSAFS is employed to determine the ideal combination of handcrafted features to maximize classification success while minimizing the number of features. To verify the effectiveness of the developed SSAFS algorithm, we conducted experimental studies using SSAFS and 5 metaheuristic algorithms. Several evaluation metrics were used to evaluate and analyze the performance of these methods on 4 datasets from the UCI machine learning repository and 6 plant phenomics datasets from PlantVillage. Experimental results and statistical analyses validated the outstanding performance of SSAFS compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms, confirming the superiority of SSAFS in exploring the feature space and identifying the most valuable features for diseased plant image classification. This computational tool will allow us to explore an optimal combination of handcrafted features to improve plant disease recognition accuracy and processing time.",

        "abstract": "The core idea of DPlis is to construct a smooth loss function that favors noise-resilient models lying in large flat regions of the loss landscape that can effectively boost model quality and training stability under a given privacy budget. Abstract Deep learning techniques have achieved remarkable performance in wide-ranging tasks. However, when trained on privacy-sensitive datasets, the model parameters may expose private information in training data. Prior attempts for differentially private training, although offering rigorous privacy guarantees, lead to much lower model performance than the non-private ones. Besides, different runs of the same training algorithm produce models with large performance variance. To address these issues, we propose DPlis\u2013 Differentially Private Learning wIth Smoothing. The core idea of DPlis is to construct a smooth loss function that favors noise-resilient models lying in large flat regions of the loss landscape. We provide theoretical justification for the utility improvements of DPlis. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that DPlis can effectively boost model quality and training stability under a given privacy budget.",

        "abstract": "A behaviour recognition method based on anchor point selection with the KLT feature point extraction algorithm is proposed, showing that the algorithm can accurately estimate the number of people in the surveillance area. With the development of the information age and the acceleration of the process of urban intelligence, the analysis and recognition of video crowd behaviour has become a hot spot in computer vision research. Crowd behaviour recognition provides an effective technical means for video surveillance and video retrieval in public places. The aim of this paper is to investigate methods for crowd behaviour recognition in video images. The full paper begins by describing the current state of research and the research significance of this topic, arguing that the recognition of crowd behaviour is an essential component of intelligent monitoring and development. Secondly, an improved Vibe foreground detection model is proposed, and finally a behaviour recognition method based on anchor point selection with the KLT feature point extraction algorithm is proposed, showing that the algorithm can accurately estimate the number of people in the surveillance area.",

        "title": "Topology management for flying ad hoc networks based on particle swarm optimization and software-defined networking",
        "abstract": "A Software-defined networking (SDN) based manageable topology formation to construct a more resilient and manageable UAV formation is proposed, which considers a set of graph theory concepts for network evaluation to guarantee user connectivity, alternative transmission paths, and lower possible amount of nodes being points of failure, as a consequence. Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) are composed of a set of high mobility flying nodes, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), connected in an ad-hoc manner and collaborating to perform specific tasks or to achieve specific goals, such as providing connection to other nodes on the ground. The high mobility degree of UAVs, and the possible connected users on the ground, might cause fast and frequent changes in the network topology. Hence, the topology management adaptation to the UAVs\u2019 movements is required to reduce UAVs\u2019 mobility negative effects on the communication, and to improve the overall network performance. Observing these needs, this paper proposes a Software-defined networking (SDN) based manageable topology formation to construct a more resilient and manageable UAV formation. This novel proposal considers a set of graph theory concepts for network evaluation to guarantee user connectivity, alternative transmission paths, and lower possible amount of nodes being points of failure, as a consequence. Also, the spring virtual force method is applied by using attractive-repulsive forces among nodes to accomplish the following objectives: to impose safety distance gaps for collision avoidance; to provide sufficient communication link distance for proper link quality; and to maximize area coverage for enabling end-user mobility. Finally, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm\u2019s particle selection procedure is proposed to maximize the number of interconnected nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed solution can correct routing policies and reestablish connections in every occurrence of failure. The results also indicate that the considered packet loss was significantly lower compared to the state-of-the-art, achieving results from 10% to 80% lower in the performed experiments, as a higher number of packets were delivered within the required delay limit.",

        "abstract": "Information technology and communication (ICT) plays an important role as a catalyst for organisational development and innovation. However, old information systems that are known as legacy systems often expose organisations to the risk of business failure. These systems are not only impeding the advancement in technology strategy but also hindering the organisations\u2019 business competitiveness. Nevertheless, legacy systems are essential in supporting critical functions in organisations including the public sector and could not be scrapped easily. These systems need to be given a new strength through modernisation to continue providing the best service in line with global trends. Modernisation is a complex task that involves several related aspects. In the context of the public sector, legacy systems involve a complicated information relationship, environment, and culture, while ensuring the citizens are of high priority. The implementation of a digital government represents the transformation of the public service delivery to the citizens that emphasises a citizen-centric design. This study, therefore, aims to address this concern by reviewing the factors involved and suggesting a guideline in the form of a conceptual model to assist in the modernisation of legacy systems for a citizen-centric digital government. Data from the theoretical study were analysed using content analysis. The results show that the legacy systems\u2019 modernisation comprised four main aspects, namely human, process, product, and organisation aspects, with related factors and elements. This model contributes as a reference for the public sector and provides overall guidance in performing legacy systems modernisation.",

        "abstract": "This paper is presenting an application of Intelligent Water drops (IWD) algorithm, a novel metaheuristic technique, to solve workflow scheduling problem focusing on minimization of makespan, modified to improve quality of solution and enhance convergence speed. Cloud Computing has evolved as the one of the most promising approach to execute large scale workflow applications. For successful implementation of any workflow application in cloud computing environment, one of the most significant tasks is to generate an efficient schedule before its execution. The main goal of workflow scheduling is to assign tasks to available resources in a finite time with the satisfaction of users' specified QoS constraints. As workflow scheduling is an NP complete problem, most of the previous work is based on metaheuristic techniques to achieve near optimal solutions within polynomial time. In this paper, we are presenting an application of Intelligent Water drops (IWD) algorithm, a novel metaheuristic technique, to solve workflow scheduling problem focusing on minimization of makespan. The probability function of IWD algorithm is modified to improve quality of solution and enhance convergence speed. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm achieves better results in comparison to other existing algorithms.",

First, motivated by model-based policy iteration, an iterative equation without any knowledge of system dynamics is derived by introducing simultaneous explorations. Then, the model-free reinforcement learning based on the derived iterative equation is developed to approach the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation.

        "abstract": "This work presents several distributed computing algorithms to outlier detection, starting from a distributed version of an existent algorithm, CURIO, and introducing a series of optimizations and variants that leads to a new method, Curio3XD, that allows to resolve both the common issues typical of this problem, the constraints imposed by the size and the dimensionality of the datasets. Outlier detection is a data analysis related problem, of great importance in diverse science fields and with many applications. Without a definitive formal definition and holding several other designations \u2013 deviations, anomalies, exceptions, noise, atypical data, \u2013 outliers are, succinctly, the samples in a dataset that, for some reason, are different from the rest of the set. It can be of interest to either remove them, as a filtering process to smoothing data, or collect them as new dataset holding additional information potentially relevant. Its importance can be seen from the broad range of applications, like fraud or intrusion detection, specialized pattern recognition, data filtering, scientific data mining, medical diagnosis, etc. Although an old problem, with roots in Statistics, the outlier detection problem has become more pertinent then ever and yet further difficult to deal with. Better and more ubiquitous ways of data acquisition and storage capacities increasing constantly, made the size of datasets grow considerably in recent years, along with its number and its availability. Larger volumes of data becomes harder to explore and filter, while simultaneously data treatment and analysis emerges as more demanded and fundamental in today\u2019s life. Distributed computing is a computer science paradigm to distribute hard, complex problems across several independent machines, connected on a network. A problem is break down in more simple sub-problems, that are solved simultaneous by the autonomous machines, and all resultant sub-solutions collected and put together into a final solution. Distributed computing provides a solution for the limitations in the hardware scaling, both economical and physical, by building up computational capacity, as needed, with the addition of new machines, not necessarily new or advanced models, but any commodity hardware. This work presents several distributed computing algorithms to outlier detection, starting from a distributed version of an existent algorithm, CURIO[9], and introducing a series of optimizations and variants that leads to a new method, Curio3XD, that allows to resolve both the common issues typical of this problem, the constraints imposed by the size and the dimensionality of the datasets. The final version, and its variant, is applicable for any volume of data, by scaling the hardware in the distributed computing, and to high dimensionality datasets, by moving the original exponential dependency on the dimension to a dependency, quadratic, on the local density of data, easily tunable with an algorithm parameter, the precision. Intermediate versions are presented for the sake of clarification of the process that took to the final method, and as an alternative approach, possibly useful with very sparse datasets. For a distributed computing environment with full support for the distributed system and the underlying hardware infrastructure, it was chosen Apache Hadoop[23] as a platform for developing, implementation and testing, due to its power and flexibility, and yet relatively easy usability. This constitutes an open-source solution, well studied and documented, employed by several major companies, with an excellent applicability to both clouds and local clusters. The different algorithms and variants were developed within the MapReduce programing model, and implemented in the Hadoop framework, which supports that model. MapReduce was conceived to permit the deployment of distributed computing applications in a simple, developer-oriented way, with main focus on the programmatic solutions of the problems, and leaving the underneath distributed network control and maintenance absolutely transparent. The developed implementations are included in appendix. Results of tests, with an adapted real world dataset, showed very good performances of the referred algorithms\u2019 final versions, with excellent scalability on both size and dimensionality of data, as previewed theoretically. Performance tests with the precision parameter and comparative tests between all variants developed are also presented and discussed.",

        "abstract": "The use of fire plays a vital role in studies involving human adaptation and evolution as well as landscape and environmental management, especially when it can answer questions about people\u2019s movement across space, their resource availability and occupation (e.g., intensity and duration). The Australian landscape contains numerous combustion features making it particularly challenging to understand fire use, primarily due to erosional systems impacting in-situ deposits. Although they are one of the most easily recognizable features of past Aboriginal occupation, their preservation is a complex issue created by exposure through erosional processes in the form of wind and rain. This has added difficulties to developing interpretation surrounding how they reflect occupational intensity and understanding their use. The purpose of this case study is to explore several combustion sites to understand their geomagnetic signatures in relation to their environmental setting and how these vary based on erosional processes and geomorphology. Using magnetic gradiometry, we mapped six combustion sites in the Channel Country of far south-western Queensland, an arid central desert landscape characterized by low gradient fluvial and aeolian sedimentation (e.g., sand dunes). Results indicate that many of the geophysical signatures were largely dependent on the site\u2019s geomorphological history but that there was a strong potential for intact combustion features. This has important implications for cultural heritage management and our research partners, the Mithaka Aboriginal Corporation, who seek ways to monitor sites affected by erosion and ground-test sites where information about past land use can be studied.",

        "abstract": "A multi-level memory-augmented appearance-motion correspondence framework that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and utilizes the difference from normal prototype features to suppress the reconstruction capacity caused by skip-connection, achieving the tradeoff between the good reconstruction of normal data and the poor reconstruction of abnormal data. Frame prediction based on AutoEncoder plays a significant role in unsupervised video anomaly detection. Ideally, the models trained on the normal data could generate larger prediction errors of anomalies. However, the correlation between appearance and motion information is underutilized, which makes the models lack an understanding of normal patterns. Moreover, the models do not work well due to the uncontrollable generalizability of deep AutoEncoder. To tackle these problems, we propose a multi-level memory-augmented appearance-motion correspondence framework. The latent correspondence between appearance and motion is explored via appearance-motion semantics alignment and semantics replacement training. Besides, we also introduce a Memory-Guided Suppression Module, which utilizes the difference from normal prototype features to suppress the reconstruction capacity caused by skip-connection, achieving the tradeoff between the good reconstruction of normal data and the poor reconstruction of abnormal data. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, achieving AUCs of 99.6\\%, 93.8\\%, and 76.3\\% on UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue, and ShanghaiTech datasets.",

Face detection has witnessed significant progress due to the advances of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Its central issue in recent years is how to improve the detection performance of tiny faces. To this end, many recent works propose some specific strategies, redesign the architecture and introduce new loss functions for tiny object detection. In this report, we start from the popular one-stage RetinaNet approach and apply some recent tricks to obtain a high performance face detector. Specifically, we apply the Intersection over Union (IoU) loss function for regression, employ the two-step classification and regression for detection, revisit the data augmentation based on data-anchor-sampling for training, utilize the max-out operation for classification and use the multi-scale testing strategy for inference. As a consequence, the proposed face detection method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the most popular and challenging face detection benchmark WIDER FACE dataset.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. An improved nitrogen dioxide (NO2) slant column density retrieval for the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) in the 405\u2013465 nm spectral region is presented. Since the launch of OMI on board NASA's EOS-Aura satellite in 2004, differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) retrievals of NO2 slant column densities have been the starting point for the KNMI DOMINO and NASA SP NO2 vertical column data as well as the OMI NO2 data of some other institutes. However, recent intercomparisons between NO2 retrievals from OMI and other UV/Vis and limb spectrometers, as well as ground-based measurements, suggest that OMI stratospheric NO2 is biased high. This study revises and, for the first time, fully documents the OMI NO2 retrieval in detail. The representation of the OMI slit function to convolve high-resolution reference spectra onto the relevant spectral grid is improved. The window used for the wavelength calibration is optimised, leading to much-reduced fitting errors. Ozone and water vapour spectra used in the fit are updated, reflecting the recently improved knowledge of their absorption cross section in the literature. The improved spectral fit also accounts for absorption by the O2\u2013O2 collision complex and by liquid water over clear-water areas. The main changes in the improved spectral fitting result from the updates related to the wavelength calibration: the RMS error of the fit is reduced by 23% and the NO2 slant column by 0.85 \u00d7 1015 molec cm\u22122, independent of latitude, solar zenith angle and NO2 value. Including O2\u2013O2 and liquid water absorption and updating the O3 and water vapour cross-section spectra further reduces NO2 slant columns on average by 0.35 \u00d7 1015 molec cm\u22122, accompanied by a further 9% reduction in the RMS error of the fit. The improved OMI NO2 slant columns are consistent with independent NO2 retrievals from other instruments to within a range that can be explained by photochemically driven diurnal increases in stratospheric NO2 and by small differences in fitting window and approach. The revisions indicate that current OMI NO2 slant columns suffered mostly from an additive positive offset, which is removed by the improved wavelength calibration and representation of the OMI slit function. It is therefore anticipated that the improved NO2 slant columns are most important to retrievals of spatially homogeneous stratospheric NO2 rather than to heterogeneous tropospheric NO2.",

        "abstract": "It is argued that mangroves within IMA shrimp systems provide biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services that are, at best, compromised, especially when compared to intact mangrove forests. Aquaculture production is projected to surpass wild-capture fisheries as the primary source of aquatic animal protein in the near future. Farmed shrimp\u2014which are amongst the most valuable aquaculture commodities\u2014are raised predominantly in Southeast Asia and Latin America in a variety of production systems, spanning from extensive to intensive farming. Shrimp aquaculture has been widely criticized for causing mangrove forest degradation and loss, leading to calls for more sustainable aquaculture approaches that protect mangroves. Here we examine an approach promoted as more sustainable\u2014integrated mangrove aquaculture (IMA): a type of farming where mangroves are planted in or alongside shrimp ponds. We argue that mangroves within IMA shrimp systems provide biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services that are, at best, compromised, especially when compared to intact mangrove forests. Given the rapid adoption of IMA approaches, including advocacy for uptake from many governments and non-governmental organizations, there is an urgent need to ensure that these and other aquaculture systems do not result in any conversion of intact mangrove ecosystems into aquaculture ponds, and to identify any benefits (or lack thereof) provided by IMA systems. The increasing adoption of IMA may offer false promises for managing trade-offs between increasing aquaculture productivity and mangrove forest conservation.",

        "abstract": "A simple CNN based on the LeNet architecture is proposed to perform LULC classification over Sentinel-2 images, outperforming traditional machine learning methods such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Networks, as well as state-of-the-art complex deep learning methodssuch as ResNet, DenseNet and EfficientNet. Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing data is a challenging problem that has evolved with the update and launch of new satellites in orbit. As new satellites are launched with higher spatial and spectral resolution and shorter revisit times, LULC classification has evolved to take advantage of these improvements. However, these advancements also bring new challenges, such as the need for more sophisticated algorithms to process the increased volume and complexity of data. In recent years, deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promising results in this area. Training deep learning models with complex architectures require cutting-edge hardware, which can be expensive and not accessible to everyone. In this study, a simple CNN based on the LeNet architecture is proposed to perform LULC classification over Sentinel-2 images. Simple CNNs such as LeNet require less computational resources compared to more-complex architectures. A total of 11 LULC classes were used for training and validating the model, which were then used for classifying the sub-basins. The analysis showed that the proposed CNN achieved an Overall Accuracy of 96.51% with a kappa coefficient of 0.962 in the validation data, outperforming traditional machine learning methods such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Networks, as well as state-of-the-art complex deep learning methods such as ResNet, DenseNet and EfficientNet. Moreover, despite being trained in over seven million images, it took five h to train, demonstrating that our simple CNN architecture is only effective but is also efficient.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a biometric method based on finger vein and face bimodal feature layer fusion, which uses a convolutional neural network (CNN), and the fusion occurs in the feature layer. In today\u2019s information age, how to accurately identify a person\u2019s identity and protect information security has become a hot topic of people from all walks of life. At present, a more convenient and secure solution to identity identification is undoubtedly biometric identification, but a single biometric identification cannot support increasingly complex and diversified authentication scenarios. Using multimodal biometric technology can improve the accuracy and safety of identification. This paper proposes a biometric method based on finger vein and face bimodal feature layer fusion, which uses a convolutional neural network (CNN), and the fusion occurs in the feature layer. The self-attention mechanism is used to obtain the weights of the two biometrics, and combined with the RESNET residual structure, the self-attention weight feature is cascaded with the bimodal fusion feature channel Concat. To prove the high efficiency of bimodal feature layer fusion, AlexNet and VGG-19 network models were selected in the experimental part for extracting finger vein and face image features as inputs to the feature fusion module. The extensive experiments show that the recognition accuracy of both models exceeds 98.4%, demonstrating the high efficiency of the bimodal feature fusion.",

        "title": "A Survey on Image Reconstruction Using Super Resolution",
        "abstract": "Imaging plays a key role in many diverse areas of application, (SR) image reconstruction is a promising technique of digital imaging which attempts to reconstruct High Resolution (HR) imagery by fusing the partial information contained within a number of under-sampled low-resolution (LR) images of that scene during the image reconstruction process. Super-resolution image reconstruction involves up-sampling of under-sampled images thereby filtering out distortions such as noise and blur. In comparison to various image enhancement techniques, super-resolution image reconstruction technique not only improves the quality of under-sampled, low-resolution images by increasing their spatial resolution but also attempts to filter out distortions. Not only do such HR images give the viewer a more pleasing picture but also offer additional details that are significant for subsequent analysis in many applications. Super Resolution Reconstruction (SRR) algorithm is considered to be one of the most promising techniques that can help to overcome the limitations due to optics and sensor resolution. 1. INTRODUCTION Super-resolution is the task of obtaining a high-resolution image of a scene given low resolution image(s) of the scene. Applications of super-resolution include satellite, forensic, medical imaging, surveillance et al. [1]. Obtaining high-resolution images directly via better hardware (better image sensors, larger chip size) is quite costly. Image interpolation methods are not considered as super-resolution methods since even the ideal sinc interpolation cannot recover the high frequency components that are lost in the low-resolution sampling process. Most of the super-resolution approaches work on the principle of combining multiple slightly-shifted low-resolution images of the scene [2]. This involves image registration, interpolation and deblurring as the basic operations. However, this technique is numerically limited to small increases in resolution. There also exist methods based on techniques like gradient profile priors [3] and sparse representation of images in an over-complete dictionary [4]. A recent approach based on a single image was proposed in [5] that exploits the redundancy of patches within the image and combines this information with example-based techniques such as [6].",

Many plants are rich in medicinal values and contain active ingredients for medicinal use. Because of factor such as global warming, increasing population, professional secrecy, lack of Government support for research activities and lack of awareness about medicinal plants, many useful plants species are now becoming extinct and are getting destroyed. Manual identification of medicinal plants is a time consuming process and need the help of experts for plants identification. To overcome this problem, automatic identification and classification of medicinal plants is needed for greater benefit to humankind. In today\u2019s era, the automatic identification and classification of medicinal plants is an active research area in the field of image processing. Feature extraction and classification are the main steps in identification of medicinal plants and classification process which affect the overall accuracy of the classification system. This paper presents literature on image processing techniques used in identification and classification of medicinal plants and also the importance and benefits of medicinal plants in recent years.",

        "title": "DAFT: Differential Feature Extraction Network Based on Adaptive Frequency Transformer for Remote Sensing Change Detection",
        "abstract": "Remote sensing change detection is an important research direction in the field of remote sensing. It is mainly used to focus on the changing information on the ground over a period of time, and to identify the interested change targets from it. The rapid changes in ground information due to social development undoubtedly increase the importance of change detection. Currently, change detection methods still have some shortcomings in dealing with complex targets, environmental noise, and other aspects. Therefore, we propose a differential feature extraction network based on adaptive frequency transformer for remote sensing change detection (DAFT). Adaptive frequency transformer (AFFormer) is capable of separating change targets and environments from a frequency perspective and capturing long-range dependencies between feature information through self-attention. Therefore, in DAFT, we use AFFormer as the backbone network to extract feature information from bitemporal images, enhancing our focus on change targets while obtaining richer and more detailed information. To our knowledge, this is the first time that AFFormer has been applied in the field of CD. To address the issues of missing location information of change targets and insufficient local feature correlation, DAFT proposes a differential features enhancement module in the feature reconstruction stage of change targets. In addition, DAFT uses DO-Conv to enhance pixel correlation calculation in convolutional operations, allowing the network to focus on richer information. By outputting results at different scales during the feature reconstruction stage, DAFT computes multiple losses that are summed up to guide the training process for better performance. The experimental results prove that DAFT achieves high versus mainstream networks. On LEVIR-CD the F1 is 91.814 and the IoU is 84.866; on WHU-CD the F1 is 92.085 and the IoU is 85.330; on GZ-CD the F1 is 86.065 and the IoU is 74.512.",

        "abstract": "The experimental results show that the designed ensemble network model is more accurate than the conventional convolution neural network in identifying underwater targets on the measured sonar image data set while ensuring a certain prediction speed. Precisely recognition of underwater targets plays a critical role in the field of underwater unmanned exploration. According to the characteristics of sonar image, in order to improve the accuracy of underwater automatic target recognition, this paper proposes an underwater target sonar image recognition method combined with improved Efficientdet and ensemble learning. According to the regional dominance principle and threshold segmentation method, the sonar image is preprocessed, and preliminary effective features extracted from preprocessed data by Efficientnet backbone, so as to balance the efficiency and power consumption of the algorithm. The feature fusion adopts the improved weighted bi-directional feature pyramid ( BiFPN ) structure to aggregate the global information and strengthen the feature representation of the shallow feature map, which optimizes the problem that the small feature extraction is not ideal due to the low resolution of the sonar image and less detail information. By building a two-level classifier to complete the learning task in an ensemble way, a better classification effect is obtained than a single classifier. This method is applied to the underwater intelligent perception group of the 10th National Marine Aircraft Design and Production Competition in 2021, and won the first prize in the country. The experimental results show that the designed ensemble network model is more accurate than the conventional convolution neural network in identifying underwater targets on the measured sonar image data set while ensuring a certain prediction speed.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a novel segmentation algorithm based on analyzing the structure of objects in sonar imagery that works well in the multi- object sonar images and calculates the variance of the window to segment the high-light areas inSonar imagery. Automatic detection of underwater objects using side-scan sonar imagery is complicated by the variability of objects, noises, and background signatures. In recent years, as the resolution of side-scan sonar is much higher than before, the sonar imagery can be generated from sonar signal for processing. The first step of underwater object detection is to segment the underwater objects from sonar imagery. In typical sonar imagery, the object contains two parts: high-light areas (echo) and the shadow behind the object. By analyzing the features of the side- scan sonar imagery, we propose a novel segmentation algorithm for multi-object side-scan sonar imagery. First we utilize a self- adaptive window to scan the imagery and calculate the variance of the window to segment the high-light areas in sonar imagery. Then the shadows of the objects are segmented by fractal dimension. At last, the final segmentation results are achieved by combining the results from the above two steps for further analysis. This segmentation algorithm is based on analyzing the structure of objects in sonar imagery and works well in the multi- object sonar imagery.",

Grape constitutes one of the most widely grown fruit crops in the India. Productivity of grape decreases due to infections caused by various types of diseases on its fruit, stem and leaf. Leaf diseases are mainly caused by bacteria, fungi, virus etc. Diseases are a major factor limiting fruit production and diseases are often difficult to control. Without accurate disease diagnosis, proper control actions cannot be used at the appropriate time. Image Processing is one of the widely used technique is adopted for the plant leaf diseases detection and classification. This paper is intended to aid in the detection and classification leaf diseases of grape using SVM classification technique. First the diseased region is found using segmentation by K-means clustering, then both color and texture features are extracted. Finally classification technique is used to detect the type of leaf disease. The proposed system can successfully detect and classify the examined disease with accuracy of 88.89%.",

The rapid adoption of machine learning has increased concerns about the privacy implications of machine learning models trained on sensitive data, such as medical records or other personal information. To address those concerns, one promising approach is Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles, or PATE, which transfers to a \"student\" model the knowledge of an ensemble of \"teacher\" models, with intuitive privacy provided by training teachers on disjoint data and strong privacy guaranteed by noisy aggregation of teachers' answers. However, PATE has so far been evaluated only on simple classification tasks like MNIST, leaving unclear its utility when applied to larger-scale learning tasks and real-world datasets. \nIn this work, we show how PATE can scale to learning tasks with large numbers of output classes and uncurated, imbalanced training data with errors. For this, we introduce new noisy aggregation mechanisms for teacher ensembles that are more selective and add less noise, and prove their tighter differential-privacy guarantees. Our new mechanisms build on two insights: the chance of teacher consensus is increased by using more concentrated noise and, lacking consensus, no answer need be given to a student. The consensus answers used are more likely to be correct, offer better intuitive privacy, and incur lower-differential privacy cost. Our evaluation shows our mechanisms improve on the original PATE on all measures, and scale to larger tasks with both high utility and very strong privacy ($\\varepsilon$ < 1.0).",

        "abstract": "This article introduces a novel representation learning approach to recognizing team intent awareness in real-time, based upon both individual human activities and the relationship between human peers in the team, and designs a new algorithm to efficiently solve the formulated regularized optimization problem. Awareness of team behaviors (e.g., individual activities and team intents) plays a critical role in human\u2013robot teaming. Autonomous robots need to be aware of the overall intent of the team they are collaborating with in order to effectively aid their human peers or augment the team\u2019s capabilities. Team intents encode the goal of the team, which cannot be simply identified from a collection of individual activities. Instead, teammate relationships must also be encoded for team intent recognition. In this article, we introduce a novel representation learning approach to recognizing team intent awareness in real-time, based upon both individual human activities and the relationship between human peers in the team. Our approach formulates the task of robot learning for team intent recognition as a joint regularized optimization problem, which encodes individual activities as latent variables and represents teammate relationships through graph embedding. In addition, we design a new algorithm to efficiently solve the formulated regularized optimization problem, which possesses a theoretical guarantee to converge to the optimal solution. To evaluate our approach\u2019s performance on team intent recognition, we test our approach on a public benchmark group activity dataset and a multisensory underground search and rescue team behavior dataset newly collected from robots in an underground environment, as well as perform a proof-of-concept case study on a physical robot. The experimental results have demonstrated both the superior accuracy of our proposed approach and its suitability for real-time applications on mobile robots.",

In a flying ad hoc network (FANET), reliable maintenance of topology confronts a huge challenge due to the highly time-varying connectivity between flying nodes. Aiming at mitigating this issue, this letter proposes a connected dominating set (CDS) based topology control mechanism iteratively for the FANETs by solving a jointed optimization problem on adjusting the node\u2019s transmission power and position during the construction of CDS. In particular, a well-tailored group of the topology constructing and maintaining algorithms are developed with a time-discretized approach.

        "abstract": "It is suggested that in order to sustain transformation and (changing) public value, multiple processes of change and redesign need to be in place, not only of the organisational processes involved, but also of regulatory and institutional aspects, such as changes to the law and in the discretion and work practice of public officials. Digital government is often seen as an enabler or even driver of transformation of public administration, with the objective of creating public value. Such transformations are complex, requiring a long process of change; often, digitalization of public services is seen as the main means to this end. We investigate how digitalization of public services can be related to public sector transformation, and how this development can be linked to public value. In order to do so, this paper first conceptualizes digital government enabled transformation based on literature. Thereafter, we present an empirical example of public e-service development in Sweden. This case illustrates how e-service development can highlight shifts in societal values, and challenges that follow when trying to sustain changing societal values. Our findings suggest that in order to sustain transformation and (changing) public value, multiple processes of change and redesign need to be in place, not only of the organisational processes involved, but also of regulatory and institutional aspects, such as changes to the law and in the discretion and work practice of public officials.",

Cloud computing is recently a booming area and has been emerging as a commercial reality in the information technology domain. Cloud computing represents supplement, consumption and delivery model for IT services that are based on internet on pay as per usage basis. The scheduling of the cloud services to the consumers by service providers influences the cost benefit of this computing paradigm. In such a scenario, Tasks should be scheduled efficiently such that the execution cost and time can be reduced. In this paper, we proposed a meta-heuristic based scheduling, which minimizes execution time and execution cost as well. An improved genetic algorithm is developed by merging two existing scheduling algorithms for scheduling tasks taking into consideration their computational complexity and computing capacity of processing elements. Experimental results show that, under the heavy loads, the proposed algorithm exhibits a good performance.",

        "abstract": "A neural network (NN)-based online simultaneous policy update algorithm (SPUA) is developed to solve the HJI equation, in which knowledge of internal system dynamics is not required. It is well known that the nonlinear H\u221e state feedback control problem relies on the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation, which is a nonlinear partial differential equation that has proven to be impossible to solve analytically. In this paper, a neural network (NN)-based online simultaneous policy update algorithm (SPUA) is developed to solve the HJI equation, in which knowledge of internal system dynamics is not required. First, we propose an online SPUA which can be viewed as a reinforcement learning technique for two players to learn their optimal actions in an unknown environment. The proposed online SPUA updates control and disturbance policies simultaneously; thus, only one iterative loop is needed. Second, the convergence of the online SPUA is established by proving that it is mathematically equivalent to Newton's method for finding a fixed point in a Banach space. Third, we develop an actor-critic structure for the implementation of the online SPUA, in which only one critic NN is needed for approximating the cost function, and a least-square method is given for estimating the NN weight parameters. Finally, simulation studies are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Concentrations of heat-fractured rock are common in some areas of western New South Wales, Australia, and are frequently identified during archaeological surveys as the eroded remains of heat-retainer hearths, a type of earth oven used in the past by Aboriginal people to cook food. However, it can be difficult to consistently identify these features since heat-fractured rocks, like other clasts lying on the surface, can be dispersed or concentrated by a variety of geomorphic processes. In this paper, we describe a method we have developed for hearth identification and description to aid the consistent recording of these features. We recommend the use of a fluxgate gradiometer as a tool to verify that concentrations of heat-fractured rock are indeed the eroded remains of heat-retainer hearths. Using a gradiometer reduces observer variability and ensures that we are not overestimating the number of hearths present by including naturally occurring groups of stones not related to hearth activity. Adoption by others of a common method of hearth identification and classification would provide some degree of standardisation that will aid understanding of the patterns of Aboriginal occupation in the past.",

        "abstract": "A novel pipeline to achieve both precise and comprehensive enclosure of video activities and two ensemble strategies using different types of IE and modalities are proposed to boost VAD performance, so as to fully exploit the temporal context and modality information for VAD. As a vital topic in media content interpretation, video anomaly detection (VAD) has made fruitful progress via deep neural network (DNN). However, existing methods usually follow a reconstruction or frame prediction routine. They suffer from two gaps: (1) They cannot localize video activities in a both precise and comprehensive manner. (2) They lack sufficient abilities to utilize high-level semantics and temporal context information. Inspired by frequently-used cloze test in language study, we propose a brand-new VAD solution named Video Event Completion (VEC) to bridge gaps above: First, we propose a novel pipeline to achieve both precise and comprehensive enclosure of video activities. Appearance and motion are exploited as mutually complimentary cues to localize regions of interest (RoIs). A normalized spatio-temporal cube (STC) is built from each RoI as a video event, which lays the foundation of VEC and serves as a basic processing unit. Second, we encourage DNN to capture high-level semantics by solving a visual cloze test. To build such a visual cloze test, a certain patch of STC is erased to yield an incomplete event (IE). The DNN learns to restore the original video event from the IE by inferring the missing patch. Third, to incorporate richer motion dynamics, another DNN is trained to infer erased patches' optical flow. Finally, two ensemble strategies using different types of IE and modalities are proposed to boost VAD performance, so as to fully exploit the temporal context and modality information for VAD. VEC can consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods by a notable margin (typically 1.5%-5% AUROC) on commonly-used VAD benchmarks. Our codes and results can be verified at github.com/yuguangnudt/VEC_VAD",

        "abstract": "A novel scale-aware progressive training mechanism to address large scale variations across faces, Inspired by curriculum learning, which gradually learns large-to-small face instances and proposes an auxiliary anchor-free enhancement module to facilitate the learning of small faces. Scale variation stands out as one of key challenges in face detection. Recent attempts have been made to cope with this issue by incorporating image/feature pyramids or adjusting anchor sampling/matching strategies. In this work, we propose a novel scale-aware progressive training mechanism to address large scale variations across faces. Inspired by curriculum learning, our method gradually learns large-to-small face instances. The preceding models learned with easier samples (i.e., large faces) can provide good initialization for succeeding learning with harder samples (i.e., small faces), ultimately deriving a better optimum of face detectors. Moreover, we propose an auxiliary anchor-free enhancement module to facilitate the learning of small faces by supplying positive anchors that may be not covered according to the criterion of IoU overlap. Such anchor-free module will be removed during inference and hence no extra computation cost is introduced. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the state-of-the-arts on the standard FDDB and WIDER FACE benchmarks. Especially, our ProgressFace-Light with MobileNet-0.25 backbone achieves 87.9% AP on the hard set of WIDER FACE, surpassing largely RetinaFace with the same backbone by 9.7%.

        "abstract": "Abstract. A 13-year analysis (2000\u20132012) of the NO2 vertical column densities derived from ground-based (GB) instruments and satellites has been carried out over the Izana NDACC (Network for the Detection of the Atmospheric Composition Change) subtropical site. Ground-based DOAS (differential optical absorption spectroscopy) and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) instruments are intercompared to test mutual consistency and then used for validation of stratospheric NO2 from OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) and SCIAMACHY (SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY). The intercomparison has been carried out taking into account the various differences existing in instruments, namely temporal coincidence, collocation, sensitivity, field of view, etc. The paper highlights the importance of considering an \u201ceffective solar zenith angle\u201d instead of the actual one when comparing direct-sun instruments with zenith sky ones for a proper photochemical correction. Results show that NO2 vertical column densities mean relative difference between FTIR and DOAS instruments is 2.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.7\u202f% for a.m. data. Both instruments properly reproduce the NO2 seasonal and the interannual variation. Mean relative difference of the stratospheric NO2 derived from OMI and DOAS is \u22120.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.7\u202f% and from OMI and FTIR is \u22121.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.7\u202f%. SCIAMACHY mean relative difference is of 3.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.7 and \u22125.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.0\u202f% for DOAS and FTIR, respectively. Note that the days used for the intercomparison are not the same for all the pairs of instruments since it depends on the availability of data. The discrepancies are found to be seasonally dependent with largest differences in winter and excellent agreement in the spring months (AMJ). A preliminary analysis of NO2 trends has been carried out with the available data series. Results show increases in stratospheric NO2 columns in all instruments but larger values in those that are GB than that expected by nitrous oxide oxidation. The possible reasons for the discrepancy between instruments and the positive trends are discussed in the text.",

        "abstract": "A clear value proposition for shrimp farmers to use natural resources and other inputs in an efficient manner is demonstrated and supports findings from corresponding research on farm-level natural resource use efficiency. There is growing interest in sustainable intensification of aquaculture production. Yet little economic analysis has been done on farm-level effects of the economic sustainability of production intensification. Data from 83 shrimp farms (43 in Vietnam and 40 in Thailand) were used to identify (through principal component and cluster analyses) 13 clusters of management practices that reflected various scales of production intensity that ranged from 0\u20131999 kg/ha/crop to 10,000 kg/ha/crop and above, for both Penaeus monodon and Litopenaeus vannamei in Vietnam and Thailand. The clusters identified reflected sets of management practices that resulted in differing yields despite similarities in stocking densities among some clusters. The enterprise budget analysis developed showed that the more intensively managed clusters outperformed the less intensively managed clusters in economic terms. More intensively managed farm clusters had lower costs per metric ton of shrimp produced and were more profitable. The greater yields of shrimp produced per hectare of land and water resources in more intensively managed shrimp farms spread annual fixed costs across a greater volume of shrimp produced and reduced the cost per metric ton of shrimp. Costs per metric ton of shrimp produced decreased from the lowest to the highest intensity level (from US$10,245 at lowest intensity to US$3484 at highest for P. monodon and from US$24,301 to US$5387 for L. vannamei in Vietnam and from US$8184 at the lowest intensity level to US$3817 at the highest intensity level per metric ton for L. vannamei in Thailand). Costs of pond amendments used in shrimp production were particularly high in Vietnam and largely unwarranted, whereas fixed costs associated with the value of land, production facilities, equipment, and labor were sufficiently high in Thailand so that net returns were negative in the long run. Nevertheless, economic losses in Thailand were less at greater levels of intensification. The study demonstrated a clear value proposition for shrimp farmers to use natural resources (such as land) and other inputs in an efficient manner and supports findings from corresponding research on farm-level natural resource use efficiency. Additional research that incorporates economic analysis into on-farm studies of sustainable intensification of aquaculture is needed to provide ongoing guidance related to sustainable management practices for aquaculture.",

        "abstract": "It is demonstrated that ground sampling distance is the most important factor in obtaining good semantic segmentation results, but a suitable number of bands can be as important. Land use classification using aerial imagery can be complex. Characteristics such as ground sampling distance, resolution, number of bands and the information these bands convey are the keys to its accuracy. Random Forest is the most widely used approach but better and more modern alternatives do exist. In this paper, state-of-the-art methods are evaluated, consisting of semantic segmentation networks such as UNet and DeepLabV3+. In addition, two datasets based on aircraft and satellite imagery are generated as a new state of the art to test land use classification. These datasets, called UOPNOA and UOS2, are publicly available. In this work, the performance of these networks and the two datasets generated are evaluated. This paper demonstrates that ground sampling distance is the most important factor in obtaining good semantic segmentation results, but a suitable number of bands can be as important. This proves that both aircraft and satellite imagery can produce good results, although for different reasons. Finally, cost performance for an inference prototype is evaluated, comparing various Microsoft Azure architectures. The evaluation concludes that using a GPU is unnecessarily costly for deployment. A GPU need only be used for training.",

        "abstract": "A multimodal biometric recognition method based on three biometric modalities of face, iris and palmprint under the framework of deep learning and a variety of feature fusion strategies are introduced for exploring the influence of fusion methods and mechanism on recognition performance. With the growing demand for information security, biometric recognition technology has been widely used in daily life. Due to the disadvantages of unimodal biometric system, multimodal biometric recognition has become more popular. In view of the excellent performance of deep learning theory and method in various recognition tasks, this paper proposes a multimodal biometric recognition method based on three biometric modalities of face, iris and palmprint under the framework of deep learning. Firstly, in order to investigate the effect of model structure on recognition accuracy, we design the different structures of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for unimodal biometric recognition. Then, combined with the results of unimodal recognition, we construct a CNN model based on two-layer fusion for multimodal biometric recognition. Specifically, a variety of feature fusion strategies are introduced for exploring the influence of fusion methods and mechanism on recognition performance. Finally, a large number of experiments are carried out on three standard databases. The experimental results show that the proposed multimodal recognition method has higher recognition accuracy than unimodal recognition. Moreover, the two-layer fusion mechanism can further improve the multimodal recognition performance.",

        "abstract": "An algorithm to reconstruct a high- resolution image from multiple aliased low-resolution images, which is based on the generalized deconvolution technique, and it is shown that the artifact caused by inaccurate motion information is reduced by regular- ization. While high-resolution images are required for various applica- tions, aliased low-resolution images are only available due to the physi- cal limitations of sensors. We propose an algorithm to reconstruct a high- resolution image from multiple aliased low-resolution images, which is based on the generalized deconvolution technique. The conventional approaches are based on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) since the aliasing effect is easily analyzed in the frequency domain. However, the useful solution may not be available in many cases, i.e., the underdeter- mined cases or the insufficient subpixel information cases. To compen- sate for such ill-posedness, the generalized regularization is adopted in the spatial domain. Furthermore, the usage of the discrete cosine trans- form (DCT) instead of the DFT leads to a computationally efficient recon- struction algorithm. The validity of the proposed algorithm is both theo- retically and experimentally demonstrated. It is also shown that the artifact caused by inaccurate motion information is reduced by regular- ization. \u00a9 1999 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers. (S0091-3286(99)00508-5)",

ABSTRACT Malaysian medicinal plants may be abundant natural resources but there has not been much research done on preserving the knowledge of these medicinal plants which enables general public to know the leaf using computing capability. This study proposes a framework to identify and classify tropical medicinal plants in Malaysia based the extracted patterns from the leaf. The extracted patterns from medicinal plant leaf are obtained based on several angle features. Five classifiers, obtained from WEKA and an ensemble classifier, called Direct Ensemble Classifier for Imbalanced Multiclass Learning (DECIML), are used to compare their performance accuracies over this data. In this experiment, five species of Malaysian medicinal plants are identified and classified in which each species will be represented by using 65 images. This study is important in order to assist local community to utilize the knowledge discovery and application of Malaysian medicinal plants for future generation.

        "abstract": "DARNet is a densely attentive refinement network based on the U-shape encoder\u2013decoder architecture with the Siamese network as a feature extractor to improve change detection on bitemporal very-high-resolution remote sensing images. Detecting changes using bitemporal remote sensing imagery is vital to understand the dynamics of the land surface. Existing change detection models based on deep learning suffer from the problem of scale variation and pseudochange due to their insufficient multilevel aggregation and inadequate capability of feature representation, which limits the accuracy. This study proposes a densely attentive refinement network (DARNet) to improve change detection on bitemporal very-high-resolution remote sensing images. DARNet is based on the U-shape encoder\u2013decoder architecture with the Siamese network as a feature extractor. The dense skip connection module (DSCM) is employed between the decoder and the encoder to aggregate multilevel feature maps. The hybrid attention module (HAM) is integrated to exploit contextual information and generate discriminative features. The recurrent refinement module (RRM) is exploited to progressively refine the predicted change maps during the decoding process. Experiments on testing the model performance were conducted on three benchmark datasets: the season-varying change detection (SVCD) dataset, the Sun Yat-sen University change detection (SYSU-CD) dataset, and the Learning Vision and Remote Sensing Laboratory building change detection (LEVIR-CD) dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that DARNet outperforms state-of-the-art models with kappa of 96.58%, 75.35%, and 90.69% for the SVCD, SYSU-CD, and LEVIR-CD datasets, respectively.",

        "abstract": "The experimental results show that the proposed prior-knowledge-based threshold segmentation method of underwater linear object detection could maintain a good tradeoff between the segmentation quality and the computational time in comparison with conventional segmentation methods. Raw sonar images may not be used for underwater detection or recognition directly because disturbances such as the grating-lobe and multi-path disturbance affect the gray-level distribution of sonar images and cause phantom echoes. To search for a more robust segmentation method with a reasonable computational cost, a prior-knowledge-based threshold segmentation method of underwater linear object detection is discussed. The possibility of guiding the segmentation threshold evolution of forward-looking sonar images using prior knowledge is verified by experiment. During the threshold evolution, the collinear relation of two lines that correspond to double peaks in the voting space of the edged image is used as the criterion of termination. The interaction is reflected in the sense that the Hough transform contributes to the basis of the collinear relation of lines, while the binary image generated from the current threshold provides the resource of the Hough transform. The experimental results show that the proposed method could maintain a good tradeoff between the segmentation quality and the computational time in comparison with conventional segmentation methods. The proposed method redounds to a further process for unsupervised underwater visual understanding.",

Grape\u00a0leaf diseases have a major impact on the growth of grape industry and grape crop yield. Thus, there is a need of a grape disease detection in early stages of disease so that disease spread and their impact could be controlled and development and production of grape industry remain continuous and active. However, the detection of grape leaf disease in initial stages is highly critical and challenging. Therefore, in this article, machine learning technique is adopted for the early detection of grape leaf disease and accurately distinguish between various classes of disease. Furthermore, Convolutional Neural Network based Classification (CNNC) model and improvised K- Nearest Neighbor (IKNN) model are introduced for classification of leaf diseases. High quality histogram and extended histogram features are obtained to provide structural, pattern, boundary and discriminative information. Then, classification process is performed on the obtained high quality gradient based features. Classification accuracy is improved to a great extent using proposed CNNC and IKNN model. The accuracy of the proposed CNNC and IKKN model is tested with the help of public dataset named as Plant-Village Dataset. The performance of proposed CNNC and IKKN model is compared with various traditional classification models considering classification accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Two novel methods based on the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework are proposed to support the training of ML models with individualized privacy guarantees and improve the privacy-utility trade-off in scenarios in which different data holders consent to contribute their sensitive data at different individual privacy levels. Applying machine learning (ML) to sensitive domains requires privacy protection of the underlying training data through formal privacy frameworks, such as differential privacy (DP). Yet, usually, the privacy of the training data comes at the cost of the resulting ML models' utility. One reason for this is that DP uses one uniform privacy budget epsilon for all training data points, which has to align with the strictest privacy requirement encountered among all data holders. In practice, different data holders have different privacy requirements and data points of data holders with lower requirements can contribute more information to the training process of the ML models. To account for this need, we propose two novel methods based on the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework to support the training of ML models with individualized privacy guarantees. We formally describe the methods, provide a theoretical analysis of their privacy bounds, and experimentally evaluate their effect on the final model's utility using the MNIST, SVHN, and Adult income datasets. Our empirical results show that the individualized privacy methods yield ML models of higher accuracy than the non-individualized baseline. Thereby, we improve the privacy-utility trade-off in scenarios in which different data holders consent to contribute their sensitive data at different individual privacy levels.",

        "abstract": "A novel differential evolution algorithm is introduced to address the adverse effects caused by the instability of the initial trajectory parameters while reducing the energy of the palletizing robot. Energy saving in palletizing robot is a fundamental problem in the field of industrial robots. However, the palletizing robot often suffers from the problems of high energy consumption and lacking flexibility. In this work, we introduce a novel differential evolution algorithm to address the adverse effects caused by the instability of the initial trajectory parameters while reducing the energy. Specially, a simplified analytical model of the palletizing robot is firstly developed. Then, the simplified analytical model and the differential evolutionary algorithm are combined to form a planner with the goal of reducing energy consumption. The energy saving planner optimizes the initial parameters of the trajectories collected by the bionic demonstration system, which in turn enables a reduction in the operating power consumption of the palletizing robot. The major novelty of this article is the use of a differential evolutionary algorithm that can save the energy consumption as well as boosting its flexibility. Comparing with the traditional algorithms, the proposed method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance. Simulated and actual experimental results illustrate that the optimized trajectory parameters can effectively reduce the energy consumption of palletizing robot by 16%.",

Research on the digital transformation of public administrations often focuses on responding to the needs and providing benefits to external stakeholders and users, such as citizens and businesses. The study presented here focuses on one specific stakeholder, the employees of a department within the Federal Government of Lower Austria. Using a multi-method and granular qualitative research approach, the results are interpreted in the context of Perez's (2009) four phases of the digital transformation paradigm. The results show how the department is implementing the recommendations made in the literature and digital strategies: an extensive use of ICTs, the development of information-based services, and an acceleration of transactions and interactions with external stakeholders. At the same time, their perspectives point out some barriers regarding the implementation and use of new digital tools such as digital signatures, the legal frameworks at the national and regional level, and the need for an organizational culture that supports innovation. This study empirically contributes to the literature by providing an analysis of the digital transformation of a public administration as perceived by the employees.",

        "abstract": "A genetic algorithm based scheduling approach is proposed in which initial population is generated with advance version of Max Min to get more optimize results, in terms of make span. Cloud computing is a provider of dynamic services which offers readily elastic on demand computing resources as per the customer's request in economical way. As there are a lot of requests fabricated by cloud users which are processed by the accessible resources, there exists a need for better and effective scheduling mechanism for efficient allocation of resources. In this paper, a genetic algorithm based scheduling approach is proposed in which initial population is generated with advance version of Max Min by which we can get more optimize results, in terms of make span. The performance of the proposed Modified Genetic Algorithm (MGA) and existing algorithms have been evaluated against the sample data. Experimental results show that proposed algorithm exhibits acceptable performance and outperforms the existing algorithms.",

        "abstract": "An off-policy reinforcement leaning (RL) method is introduced to learn the solution of HJI equation from real system data instead of mathematical system model, and its convergence is proved. The H\u221e control design problem is considered for nonlinear systems with unknown internal system model. It is known that the nonlinear H\u221e control problem can be transformed into solving the so-called Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation, which is a nonlinear partial differential equation that is generally impossible to be solved analytically. Even worse, model-based approaches cannot be used for approximately solving HJI equation, when the accurate system model is unavailable or costly to obtain in practice. To overcome these difficulties, an off-policy reinforcement leaning (RL) method is introduced to learn the solution of HJI equation from real system data instead of mathematical system model, and its convergence is proved. In the off-policy RL method, the system data can be generated with arbitrary policies rather than the evaluating policy, which is extremely important and promising for practical systems. For implementation purpose, a neural network (NN)-based actor-critic structure is employed and a least-square NN weight update algorithm is derived based on the method of weighted residuals. Finally, the developed NN-based off-policy RL method is tested on a linear F16 aircraft plant, and further applied to a rotational/translational actuator system.",

Among the growing number of data mining techniques in various application areas, outlier detection has gained importance in recent times. Detecting the objects in a data set with unusual properties is important as such outlier objects often contain useful information on abnormal behavior of the system described by the data set. Outlier detection has been popularly used for detection of anomalies in computer networks, fraud detection and such applications. Though a number of research efforts address the problem of detecting outliers in data sets, there are still many challenges faced by the research community in terms of identifying a suitable technique for addressing specific applications of interest. These challenges are primarily due to the large volume of high dimensional data associated with most data mining applications and also due to the performance requirements. This chapter highlights some of the important research issues that determine the nature of the outlier detection algorithm required for a typical data mining application. The research issues discussed include the method of outlier detection, size and dimensionality of the data set, and nature of the target application. Thus this chapter attempts to cover the challenges and possible research directions along with a survey of various data mining techniques dealing with the outlier detection problem.",

        "abstract": "A case study from western New South Wales, Australia, illustrates the age, preservation, and distribution of late Holocene heat-retainer hearths that are abundant in the semiarid archaeological record in the region. These hearths were constructed as underground ovens with stone heat retainers. They appear archaeologically as eroded concentrations of heat-fractured stone sometimes protecting charcoal deposits. We explore geomorphic processes influencing hearth temporal and spatial distributions using a neutral agent-based model. Parallels between model outcomes and the distribution of hearths in space and time suggest that processes of sediment erosion and deposition are having complex effects on hearth survivorship and therefore on patterns of hearth frequency. We consider the various processes that explain why hearths were made in the past and how they manifest in the present. Despite the relatively recent age of the hearths when compared with evidence for fire use in the Paleolithic record, the presence and absence of these fire features reflect the outcome of a large number of processes interacting together, not all of them related to human behavior. We use the results of the case study to comment on current behavioral models for the presence and absence of fire use in the distant past.",

        "title": "Video Abnormal Event Detection by Learning to Complete Visual Cloze Tests",
        "abstract": "A novel approach named visual cloze completion (VCC), which performs VAD by learning to complete \u201cvisual cloze tests\u201d (VCTs), and a new DNN architecture is designed as a model-level solution to utilize video semantics and temporal context. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) enable great progress in video abnormal event detection (VAD), existing solutions typically suffer from two issues: (1) The localization of video events cannot be both precious and comprehensive. (2) The semantics and temporal context are underexplored. To tackle those issues, we are motivated by the prevalent cloze test in education and propose a novel approach named Visual Cloze Completion (VCC), which conducts VAD by learning to complete \u201cvisual cloze tests\u201d (VCTs). Specifically, VCC first localizes each video event and encloses it into a spatio-temporal cube (STC). To achieve both precise and comprehensive localization, appearance and motion are used as complementary cues to mark the object region associated with each event. For each marked region, a normalized patch sequence is extracted from current and adjacent frames and stacked into a STC. With each patch and the patch sequence of a STC compared to a visual \u201cword\u201d and \u201csentence\u201d respectively, we deliberately erase a certain \u201cword\u201d (patch) to yield a VCT. Then, the VCT is completed by training DNNs to infer the erased patch and its optical flow via video semantics. Meanwhile, VCC fully exploits temporal context by alternatively erasing each patch in temporal context and creating multiple VCTs. Furthermore, we propose localization-level, event-level, model-level and decision-level solutions to enhance VCC, which can further exploit VCC\u2019s potential and produce significant performance improvement gain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VCC achieves state-of-the-art VAD performance. Our codes and results are open at https://github.com/yuguangnudt/VEC VAD/tree/VCC.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a confidence ranking network with a pairwise ranking loss to rerank the predicted confidences locally within the same image, and achieves the highest AP on the single-scale and the most competitive multi-scale methods while being significantly faster. Face detection is a fundamental problem for many down-stream face applications, and there is a rising demand for faster, more accurate yet support for higher resolution face detectors. Recent smartphones can record a video in 8K resolution, but many of the existing face detectors still fail due to the anchor size and training data. We analyze the failure cases and observe a large number of correct predicted boxes with incorrect confidences. To calibrate these confidences, we propose a confidence ranking network with a pairwise ranking loss to rerank the predicted confidences locally within the same image. Our confidence ranker is model-agnostic, so we can augment the data by choosing the pairs from multiple face detectors during the training, and generalize to a wide range of face detectors during the testing. On WiderFace, we achieve the highest AP on the single-scale, and our AP is competitive with the previous multi-scale methods while being significantly faster. On 8K resolution, our method solves the GPU memory issue and allows us to indirectly train on 8K. We collect 8K resolution test set to show the improvement, and we will release our test set as a new benchmark for future research.",

We present the trend and seasonal variability of stratospheric NO2 column for the first time over the polluted atmosphere at Hefei, China, retrieved using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) between 2015 and 2018. The FTIR observed stratospheric NO2 columns over Hefei show a peak in June and reach a minimum in January. The mean stratospheric NO2 column concentration in June is (3.49 \u00b1 0.25) \u00d7 1015 molecules*cm-2, and is 39.20% \u00b1 8.95% higher than that in January with a mean value of (2.51 \u00b1 0.21) \u00d7 1015 molecules*cm-2. We find a negative trend of (-0.34 \u00b1 0.05) %/yr in the FTIR observations of stratospheric NO2 column. The FTIR data are compared to the satellite OMI observations to assess the new data set quality and also applied to evaluate the GEOS-Chem model simulations. We find in general the OMI observations and GEOS-Chem model results are in good agreement with the coincident FTIR data, and they all show similar seasonal cycles with strong correlation coefficients of 0.84-0.86. The annual average OMI minus FTIR difference is (1.48 \u00b1 5.33) \u00d7 1014 molecules*cm-2 (4.82% \u00b1 17.37%), and average GEOS-Chem minus FTIR difference is (2.36 \u00b1 2.33) \u00d7 1014 molecules*cm -2 (7.66% \u00b1 7.49%). Their maximum differences occur in April and May with mean differences of 12-16%. We also found negative trends in the stratospheric NO2 column over Hefei for 2015-2018 with both OMI observations (-0.91 \u00b1 0.09%/yr) and GEOS-Chem model results (-0.31 \u00b1 0.05%/yr), demonstrating some consistency among them.",

        "abstract": "Self-Supervised (SS) representation learning for describing discriminative cues between healthy and pathological speech is studied in a DNN-based AVDD system and guidelines for taking advantage of DNN are suggested to boost the performance in developing automatic systems for diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of voice pathologies. Many speech features and models, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN), are used for classification tasks between healthy and pathological speech with the Saarbruecken Voice Database (SVD). However, accuracy values of 80.71% for phrases or 82.8% for vowels /aiu/ are the highest reported for audio samples in SVD when the evaluation includes the wide amount of pathologies in the database, instead of a selection of some pathologies. This paper targets this top performance in the state-of-the-art Automatic Voice Disorder Detection (AVDD) systems. In the framework of a DNN-based AVDD system we study the capability of Self-Supervised (SS) representation learning for describing discriminative cues between healthy and pathological speech. The system processes the SS temporal sequence of features with a single feed-forward layer and Class-Token (CT) Transformer for obtaining the classification between healthy and pathological speech. Furthermore, there is evaluated a suitable data extension of the training set with out-of-domain data is also evaluated to deal with the low availability of data for using DNN-based models in voice pathology detection. Experimental results using audio samples corresponding to phrases in the SVD dataset, including all pathologies available, show classification accuracy values until 93.36%. This means that the proposed AVDD system achieved accuracy improvements of 4.1% without the training data extension, and 15.62% after the training data extension compared to the baseline system. Beyond the novelty of using SS representations for AVDD, the fact of obtaining accuracies over 90% in these conditions and using the whole set of pathologies in the SVD is a milestone for voice disorder-related research. Furthermore, the study on the amount of in-domain data in the training set related to the system performance show guidance for the data preparation stage. Lessons learned in this work suggest guidelines for taking advantage of DNN, to boost the performance in developing automatic systems for diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of voice pathologies.",

However, this method requires a lengthy process and staff expertise. Urban planners need applications that are not only fast in performing spatial analysis but also do not require special skills. This study proposes a land cover classification application with one of the deep learning methods for semantic segmentation, namely DeepLabV3+. This method will be compared with Iterative Self-Organizing Clustering (ISOCLUST) and Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) in Karawang, Indonesia, as the case study. The results showed that the DeepLabV3+ accuracy was 95% which is higher than OBIA (80%). Although ISOCLUST more accurate that is usually used as ground truth dataset, this method takes a lot of time as it is semi-automatic compared to DeepLabV3+ which only takes about one minute.",

        "abstract": "The methodologies, employed databases and accuracy results of the existing works are presented to showcase the profound usage of multimodal biometric design and a comprehensive review of different fusion schemes in combining various biometric modalities is presented. ABSTRACT Biometric allude to an automatic procedure of acknowledging an individual utilizing their behavioral or physical characteristics. The biometric framework, which utilizes one cue for authentication is termed as unimodal biometric. The unimodal biometric framework confronts numerous snags like dearth of distinctiveness, universality intra-class similarity and multimodal biometric is one of best options to conquer these issues, which is a framework that utilizes two or more cues for authentication. This study presents the overview of multimodal biometric recognition systems. Multimodal biometric recognition systems augment the security and concealment of digital information. From last two decades, there are a lot of research work on information fusion. We have discussed recent trends in multimodal biometric depending upon the type of fusion scheme and the level of fusion i.e. sensor level or feature level fusion, decision level fusion, score level fusion and hybrid fusion level. The types of fusion are conversed in detail with their individual merits and demerits. In addition to that, the methodologies, employed databases and accuracy results of the existing works are presented to showcase the profound usage of multimodal biometric design. The paper is targeted toward presenting a comprehensive review of different fusion schemes in combining various biometric modalities.",

        "abstract": "This work analyzes the effect of inaccurate subpixel motion information on a high-resolution image reconstruction, and model it as zero-mean additive Gaussian errors added respectively to each low- resolution image to reduce the distortion. The demand for high-resolution images is gradually increasing, whereas many imaging systems have been designed to enable a certain level of aliasing during image acquisition. in this sense, digital image processing approaches have recently been investigated to reconstruct a high-resolution image from aliased low-resolution images. However, since the subpixel motion information is assumed to be accurate in most conventional approaches, the satisfactory high-resolution image cannot be obtained when the subpixel motion information is inaccurate. Hence, we propose a new algorithm to reduce the distortion in the reconstructed high-resolution image due to the inaccuracy of subpixel motion information. For this purpose, we analyze the effect of inaccurate subpixel motion information on a high-resolution image reconstruction, and model it as zero-mean additive Gaussian errors added respectively to each low-resolution image. To reduce the distortion, we apply the modified multichannel image deconvolution approach to the problem. The validity of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally.",

        "abstract": "Comparing several ensemble classifiers where AdaboostM1 with Random Forest as base classifier provides the best technique to the nature of the shape-based Malaysian medicinal leaf images data shows that the classifier is able to produce the best classification performance. Malaysia has abundant natural resources especially plants which can be used for medicinal or herbal purposes. However, there is less research to preserve the knowledge of these resources to be utilized by the community in identifying useful medicinal plants using computing tools. In order to support this study, finding suitable method for identification and classification must be done in order to provide better classification performance. Ensemble methods are classification methods that combines several diverse classifiers which known to perform better than single classifiers. In this regard, the best ensemble method for this specific leaf image data need to be explored and Weka has been used as the platform to compare related ensemble methods. The study in this paper compares several ensemble classifiers where AdaboostM1 with Random Forest as base classifier provides the best technique to the nature of the shape-based Malaysian medicinal leaf images data. The ensemble classifier is also tested with other shape based dataset image domain and shows that the classifier is able to produce the best classification performance.",

        "abstract": "A novel lightweight network, which identifies changes based on the features extracted by mobile networks via progressive feature aggregation and supervised attention, termed as A2Net, is proposed, which can achieve favorable results compared with the state-of-the-art methods on three challenging RSCD datasets with fewer parameters and lower computation costs. Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to explore surface changes from co-registered pair of images. However, the high cost of memory and computation in previous convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods prevent their successes from being applied to real-world applications. Therefore, we propose a novel lightweight network, which identifies changes based on the features extracted by mobile networks via progressive feature aggregation and supervised attention, termed as A2Net. Considering the less powerful representation capability of mobile networks, we design a neighbor aggregation module (NAM) to fuse features within nearby stages of the backbone to strengthen the representation capability of temporal features. Then, we propose a progressive change identifying module (PCIM) to extract temporal difference information from bitemporal features. Besides, we design a supervised attention module (SAM) to reweight features for effectively aggregating multilevel features from high levels to low levels. With NAM, PCIM, and SAM incorporated, A2Net can achieve favorable results compared with the state-of-the-art methods on three challenging RSCD datasets with fewer parameters (3.78 M) and lower computation costs (6.02 G).

Firstly, the feature is extracted from the pre-formed beams in the whole spatial domain, and then using the relevance vector machine (RVM) for training, the probability output of target detection is obtained. Compared with traditional methods, this method can obtain excellent detection performance under the condition of low signal-to-noise ratio or signal-to-interference ratio. The probability output of this method can better represent the uncertainty of target detection, and it is also convenient for information fusion and other processing, which is different from the output of traditional binary detection. At the end of the paper, simulated data and experimental data both proved that this method is effective.",

Here we proposed a grape disease identification model based on improved YOLOXS (GFCD-YOLOXS) to achieve real-time detection of grape diseases in field conditions. We build a dataset of 11,056 grape disease images in 15 categories, based on 2566 original grape disease images provided by the State Key Laboratory of Plant Pest Biology data center after pre-processing. To improve the YOLOXS algorithm, first, the FOCUS module was added to the backbone network to reduce the lack of information related to grape diseases in the convolution process so that the different depth features in the backbone network are fused. Then, the CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) was introduced at the prediction end to make the model focus on the key features of grape diseases and mitigate the influence of the natural environment. Finally, the double residual edge was introduced at the prediction end to prevent degradation in the deep network and to make full use of the non-key features. Compared with the experimental results of relevant authoritative literature, GFCD-YOLOXS had the highest identification accuracy of 99.10%, indicating the superiority of the algorithm in this paper.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a variant of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) which supports individualized privacy budgets and finds it empirically improves privacy-utility trade-offs. When training a machine learning model with differential privacy, one sets a privacy budget. This budget represents a maximal privacy violation that any user is willing to face by contributing their data to the training set. We argue that this approach is limited because different users may have different privacy expectations. Thus, setting a uniform privacy budget across all points may be overly conservative for some users or, conversely, not sufficiently protective for others. In this paper, we capture these preferences through individualized privacy budgets. To demonstrate their practicality, we introduce a variant of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) which supports such individualized budgets. DP-SGD is the canonical approach to training models with differential privacy. We modify its data sampling and gradient noising mechanisms to arrive at our approach, which we call Individualized DP-SGD (IDP-SGD). Because IDP-SGD provides privacy guarantees tailored to the preferences of individual users and their data points, we find it empirically improves privacy-utility trade-offs.",

In this paper, we prove the existence of a complete set of local topology manipulation operations that allow the transformation of a swarm topology. The set is complete in the sense that any other possible set of manipulation operations can be performed by a sequence of operations from our set. The operations are local as they depend only on the \ufb01rst and second hop neighbors\u2019 information to transform any initial spanning tree of the network\u2019s graph to any other connected tree with the same number of nodes. The \ufb02exibility provided by our method is similar to global methods that require full knowledge of the swarm network. We prove the existence of a sequence of transformations for any tree-to-tree transformation, and derive sequences of operations to form a line or star from any initial spanning tree. Our work provides a theoretical and practical framework for topological control of a swarm, establishing global properties using only local information.",

        "abstract": "This book reports the best practices that companies established in Latin America are implementing in their manufacturing processes in order to generate high quality products and stay in the market. It lists the technologies, production and administrative philosophies that are being implemented, presenting a collection of successful cases of studies from Latin America. The book describes how the tools and techniques are being integrated, modified and combined to create new technical resources for assisting the decision making process for better economic performance in manufacturing companies. The efforts deployed for assisting the transformation of raw materials into products and services are described. The authors explain the main key success factors or drivers for success of each tool, technique or hybrid combination approach applied to solve manufacturing problems. This book analyzes the set of forces driving the global financial system toward a period of radical transformation and explores the transformational challenges that lie ahead for global and regional or local banks and other financial intermediaries. It is explained how these challenges derive from the newly emerging post-crisis structure of the market and from shadow and digital players across all banking operations. Detailed attention is focused on the impacts of digitalization on the main functions of the financial system, and particularly the banking sector. The author elaborates how an alternative model of banking will enable banks to predict, understand, navigate, and change the external ecosystem in which they compete. The five critical components of this model are data and information mastering; effective use of applied analytics; interconnectivity and \u201cjunction playing\u201d; development of new business solutions; and trust and credibility assurance. The analysis is supported by a number of informative case studies. The book will be of interest especially to top and middle managers and employees of banks and financial institutions but also to FinTech players and their advisers and others. 2020 has been a challenging year worldwide for many businesses and we have not come out of that phase entirely in 2021.

        "abstract": "This work proposes a two-phase algorithm for detecting outliers in categorical data based on a novel definition of outliers, employing two independent ranking schemes based on the attribute value frequencies and the inherent clustering structure in the given data. Outlier detection being an important data mining problem has attracted a lot of research interest in the recent past. As a result, various methods for outlier detection have been developed particularly for dealing with numerical data, whereas categorical data needs some attention. Addressing this requirement, we propose a two-phase algorithm for detecting outliers in categorical data based on a novel definition of outliers. In the first phase, this algorithm explores a clustering of the given data, followed by the ranking phase for determining the set of most likely outliers. The proposed algorithm is expected to perform better as it can identify different types of outliers, employing two independent ranking schemes based on the attribute value frequencies and the inherent clustering structure in the given data. Unlike some existing methods, the computational complexity of this algorithm is not affected by the number of outliers to be detected. The efficacy of this algorithm is demonstrated through experiments on various public domain categorical data sets.",

        "abstract": "The generative nature of the archaeological record stands in contrast with reconstructive goals of the discipline. This is particularly evident in discussions of surface archaeology, which is often considered deficient for reconstructing human behavior in the past when compared with subsurface deposits. We look at a case study from Rutherfords Creek in arid southeastern Australia, where lithics and combustion features appear in differing densities across the surface. These have been interpreted variably in terms of settlement patterns; however, the relationships between accumulation, visibility, and preservation are complex. This study addresses these relationships in terms of formation dynamics, drawing out patterns from surface assemblages that bear on the mobility and resilience of the ancestral Aboriginal populations that occupied Rutherfords Creek during the late Holocene. A different view of the record emerges, one that foregrounds the notions of reversibility in the patterning to identify the kinds of questions the record might be most fruitfully brought to bear on, with implications for both surface and subsurface archaeology.",

        "abstract": "Temporal Masked Auto-Encoding (TMAE) is proposed as an effective end-to-end UVAD method that significantly outperforms existing UVAD methods by a notable margin and is applied on optical flow, which can further boost performance. Unsupervised video anomaly detection (UVAD) intends to discern anomalous events from fully unlabeled videos. However, existing UVAD methods suffer from poor performance. Inspired by recent masked autoencoder (MAE) [1], we propose Temporal Masked Auto-Encoding (TMAE) as an effective end-to-end UVAD method. Specifically, we first denote video events by spatial-temporal cubes (STCs), which are built by temporally consecutive foreground patches from unlabeled videos. Then, half of patches in an STC are masked along the temporal dimension, while a vision transformer (ViT) is trained to exploit unmasked patches to predict masked patches. The rare and unusual nature of anomaly will result in a poorer prediction for anomalous events, which enables us to discriminate anomalies from unlabeled videos and compute the anomaly scores. Furthermore, to utilize motion clues in videos, we also propose to apply TMAE on optical flow, which can further boost performance. Experiments show that TMAE significantly outperforms existing UVAD methods by a notable margin (3.9%\u20136.6% AUC).",

        "abstract": "The seasonal variations of HCl over Hefei is similar to that in other northern hemisphere mid-latitude FTIR stations and GEOS-Chem model data present a good agreement with FTIR data in seasonal variation and inter-annul trend. In this study, the characterization of Hydrogen Chloride (HCl) seasonal variations and inter-annual linear trend are presented for the first time over the polluted region at Hefei (117\u00b010'E, 31\u00b054'N), China. The time series of HCl were retrieved by the mid-infrared (MIR) solar spectra recorded by the ground-based high-resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) between July, 2015 and April, 2019. The magnitude of HCl reaches a peak in January (2.70 \u00b1 0.16)\u2009\u00d7\u20091015 molecules*cm-2 and a minimum in September (2.27 \u00b1 0.09)\u2009\u00d7\u20091015 molecules*cm-2. The four-year time series of HCl total column show a negative linear trend of (-1.83 \u00b1 0.13) %. The FTIR data are compared with GEOS-Chem data in order to evaluate the performance of the GEOS-Chem model to simulate HCl. In general, total column FTIR data and GEOS-Chem model data are in a good agreement with a correlation coefficient of 0.82. GEOS-Chem model data present a good agreement with FTIR data in seasonal variation and inter-annul trend. The maximum differences occur in January and April with mean differences of 4%-6%. We also present HCl time series observed by 6 NDACC stations (Bremen, Toronto, Rikubetsu, Izana, Reunion.maido, Lauder) in low-middle-latitude sites of the northern and southern hemispheres and Hefei stations in order to investigate the seasonal and annual trends of HCl in low-middle-latitude sites. The HCl total column at the northern hemisphere stations reached the maximum in the late winter or early spring and the minimum in the early winter or late autumn. In general, the seasonal variations of HCl over Hefei is similar to that in other northern hemisphere mid-latitude FTIR stations.",

This paper describes a preliminary investigation of Voice Pathology Detection using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). We used voice recordings of sustained vowel /a/ produced at normal pitch from German corpus Saarbruecken Voice Database (SVD). This corpus contains voice recordings and electroglottograph signals of more than 2 000 speakers. The idea behind this experiment is the use of convolutional layers in combination with recurrent Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) layers on raw audio signal. Each recording was split into 64 ms Hamming windowed segments with 30 ms overlap. Our trained model achieved 71.36% accuracy with 65.04% sensitivity and 77.67% specificity on 206 validation files and 68.08% accuracy with 66.75% sensitivity and 77.89% specificity on 874 testing files. This is a promising result in favor of this approach because it is comparable to similar previously published experiment that used different methodology. Further investigation is needed to achieve the state-of-the-art results.",

        "abstract": "Land cover mapping is an important part of resource management, planning, and economic predictions. Improvements in remote sensing, machine learning, image processing, and object based image analysis (OBIA) has made the process of identifying land cover types increasingly faster and reliable but these advances have not been able to utilize all of the information encompassed within ultra-high (sub-meter) resolution imagery. There have been few known attempts to try and maximize this detailed information in high resolution imagery using advanced textural components. Hierarchical land classes are also rarely used as an attribute within the machine learning step of object-based image analysis. In this study we try to circumnavigate the inherent problems associated with high resolution imagery by combining well researched data transformations that aid the OBIA process with a seldom used texture transformation in Geographic Object Based Image Analyses (GEOBIA/OBIA) known as the Gabor Transform and the hierarchal organization of landscapes. We will observe the difference made in segmentation and classification accuracy of a random forest classifier when we fuse a Gabor transformed image to a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), high resolution multi-spectral imagery (RGB and NIR) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) derived canopy height model (CHM) within a riparian area in Southeast Iowa, United States. Additionally, we will observe the effects on classification accuracy when adding multi-scale land cover data to objects. Both, the addition of hierarchical information and Gabor textural information, could aid the GEOBIA process in delineating and classifying the same objects that human experts would delineate within this riparian landscape.",

        "abstract": "A new degree of fusion, known as an intelligent Dual Multimodal Biometric Authentication Scheme, is established in this study and makes use of the highest TPR, FPR, and accuracy rates. Identity management describes a problem by providing the authorized owners with safe and simple access to information and solutions for specific identification processes. The shortcomings of the unimodal systems have been addressed by the introduction of multimodal biometric systems. The use of multimodal systems has increased the biometric system\u2019s overall recognition rate. A new degree of fusion, known as an intelligent Dual Multimodal Biometric Authentication Scheme, is established in this study. In the proposed work, two multimodal biometric systems are developed by combining three unimodal biometric systems. ECG, sclera, and fingerprint are the unimodal systems selected for this work. The sequential model biometric system is developed using a decision-level fusion based on WOA-ANN. The parallel model biometric system is developed using a score-level fusion based on SSA-DBN. The biometric authentication performs preprocessing, feature extraction, matching, and scoring for each unimodal system. On each biometric attribute, matching scores and individual accuracy are cyphered independently. A matcher performance-based fusion procedure is demonstrated for the three biometric qualities because the matchers on these three traits produce varying values. The two-level fusion technique (score and feature) is implemented separately, and their results with the current scheme are compared to exhibit the optimum model. The suggested plan makes use of the highest TPR, FPR, and accuracy rates.",

In this paper, we propose a high-resolution image reconstruction algorithm to reduce the distortion in the reconstructed high-resolution image due to the inaccuracy of motion estimation. For this purpose, we analyze the noise caused by the inaccurate motion information. Based on this analysis, we propose a new regularization functional. The proposed algorithm requires no prior information about the original image or the inaccurate motion information.

We consider the problem of reconstructing remotely obtained images from image-plane detector arrays. Although the individual detectors may be larger than the blur spot of the imaging optics, high-resolution reconstructions can be obtained by scanning or rotating the image with respect to the detector. As an alternative to matrix inversion or least-squares estimation [Appl. Opt. 26, 3615 (1987)], the method of convex projections is proposed. We show that readily obtained prior knowledge can be used to obtain good-quality imagery with reduced data. The effect of noise on the reconstruction process is considered.",

It was carried out through face to face interviews with respondents and collection and identification of medicinal plants in the village. A total of 56 species of medicinal plants were recorded during a series of folk botanical surveys at a village at Terengganu, Malaysia. A majority of these species are herbaceous angiosperms, followed by trees and shrubs. The most common part of plant used in preparing herbal medicine is the leaves. More plants are used for general health, to treat dermatological complaints, reproductive system, abdominal problems and fever compared to other ailments. The most common method of preparation is poultice, followed by decoction and infusion. Thus, more medicinal plants are used topically than orally.",
