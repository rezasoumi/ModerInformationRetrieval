        "abstract": "Using pre-trained language models can improve AD prediction not only solves the problem of lack of sufficiently large datasets, but also reduces the need for expert-defined features. Background We developed transformer-based deep learning models based on natural language processing for early risk assessment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease from the picture description test. Methods The lack of large datasets poses the most important limitation for using complex models that do not require feature engineering. Transformer-based pre-trained deep language models have recently made a large leap in NLP research and application. These models are pre-trained on available large datasets to understand natural language texts appropriately, and are shown to subsequently perform well on classification tasks with small training sets. The overall classification model is a simple classifier on top of the pre-trained deep language model. Results The models are evaluated on picture description test transcripts of the Pitt corpus, which contains data of 170 AD patients with 257 interviews and 99 healthy controls with 243 interviews. The large bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT Large ) embedding with logistic regression classifier achieves classification accuracy of 88.08%, which improves the state-of-the-art by 2.48%. Conclusions Using pre-trained language models can improve AD prediction. This not only solves the problem of lack of sufficiently large datasets, but also reduces the need for expert-defined features.",

In this paper, we first introduce a multi-graph including different types of relations between words. Then, we propose Multi-Graph augmented BERT (MG-BERT) model that is based on BERT. MG-BERT embeds tokens while taking advantage of a static multi-graph containing global word co-occurrences in the text corpus beside global real-world facts about words in knowledge graphs.

        "abstract": "A novel method for automated analysis of \u201cirregularity\u201d in an in vitro model of cardiotoxicity experiments is introduced, which may overcome the drawbacks of using predesigned features that restricts the classification performance to the comprehensiveness and the quality of the designed features. An early characterization of drug-induced cardiotoxicity may be possible by combining comprehensive in vitro proarrhythmia assay and deep learning techniques. We aimed to develop a method to automatically detect irregular beating rhythm of field potentials recorded from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CM) by multi-electrode array (MEA) system. We included field potentials from 380 experiments, which were labeled as normal or arrhythmic by electrophysiology experts. Convolutional and recurrent neural networks (CNN and RNN) were employed for automatic classification of field potential recordings. A preparation phase was initially applied to split 60-s long recordings into a series of 5-s windows. Subsequently, the classification phase comprising of two main steps was designed and applied. The first step included the classification of 5-s windows by using a designated CNN. While, the results of 5-s window assessments were used as the input sequence to an RNN that aggregates these results in the second step. The output was then compared to electrophysiologist-level arrhythmia detection, resulting in 0.83 accuracy, 0.93 sensitivity, 0.70 specificity, and 0.80 precision. In summary, this paper introduces a novel method for automated analysis of \u201cirregularity\u201d in an in vitro model of cardiotoxicity experiments. Thus, our method may overcome the drawbacks of using predesigned features that restricts the classification performance to the comprehensiveness and the quality of the designed features. Furthermore, automated analysis may facilitate the quality control experiments through the procedure of drug development with respect to cardiotoxicity and avoid late drug attrition from market.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a deep learning framework for the segmentation of whole and viable tumor areas of liver cancer from whole-slide images (WSIs) using Fast Segmentation Convolutional Neural Network (Fast-SCNN) as the network. Liver masses have become a common clinical challenge since they require to be defined and accurately categorized as neoplastic or nonneoplastic lesions. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common histologic type of primary liver malignancy, is a global health concern being the fifth most common cancer and the second cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Accurate diagnosis, which in some circumstances requires histopathology results, is necessary for appropriate management. Also, some tumor characteristics help in predicting tumor behavior and patient response to therapy. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework for the segmentation of whole and viable tumor areas of liver cancer from whole-slide images (WSIs). To this end, we use Fast Segmentation Convolutional Neural Network (Fast-SCNN) as our network. We use the dataset from PAIP 2019 challenge. After data-augmentation on the training subset, we train the network with a multi-term loss function and SWA technique. Our model achieves 0.80 for the median of the Jaccard Index for the task of Viable Tumor Segmentation and 0.77 for the median of Weighted Absolute Accuracy for the task of Viable Tumor Burden Estimation on the whole-slide images of the test subset.",

Recently, the problem of integrating side information about classes has emerged in the learning settings like zero-shot learning. Although using multiple sources of information about the input space has been investigated in the last decade and many multi-view and multi-modal learning methods have already been introduced, the attribute learning for classes (output space) is a new problem that has been attended in the last few years. In this paper, we propose an attribute learning method that can use different sources of descriptions for classes to find new attributes that are more proper to be used as class signatures.

        "abstract": "The transfer learning method in this study improves AD prediction, which does not only reduces the need for feature engineering but also addresses the lack of sufficiently large datasets. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is difficult to be detected using convenient and reliable methods. The language change in patients with AD is an important signal of their cognitive status, which potentially helps in early diagnosis. In this study, we developed a transfer learning model based on speech and natural language processing (NLP) technology for the early diagnosis of AD. The lack of large datasets limits the use of complex neural network models without feature engineering, while transfer learning can effectively solve this problem. The transfer learning model is firstly pre-trained on large text datasets to get the pre-trained language model, and then, based on such a model, an AD classification model is performed on small training sets. Concretely, a distilled bidirectional encoder representation (distilBert) embedding, combined with a logistic regression classifier, is used to distinguish AD from normal controls. The model experiment was evaluated on Alzheimer's dementia recognition through spontaneous speech datasets in 2020, including the balanced 78 healthy controls (HC) and 78 patients with AD. The accuracy of the proposed model is 0.88, which is almost equivalent to the champion score in the challenge and a considerable improvement over the baseline of 75% established by organizers of the challenge. As a result, the transfer learning method in this study improves AD prediction, which does not only reduces the need for feature engineering but also addresses the lack of sufficiently large datasets.",

        "abstract": "This study proposes a novel feature purification network that can improve the representation learning of transformer model further and applies it to improve transformer's performance on three public dementia datasets and gets improved classification results markedly. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease involving the decline of cognitive ability with illness progresses. At present, the diagnosis of AD mainly depends on the interviews between patients and doctors, which is slow, expensive, and subjective, so it is not a better solution to recognize AD using the currently available neuropsychological examinations and clinical diagnostic criteria. A recent study has indicated the potential of language analysis for AD diagnosis. In this study, we proposed a novel feature purification network that can improve the representation learning of transformer model further. Though transformer has made great progress in generating discriminative features because of its long-distance reasoning ability, there is still room for improvement. There exist many common features that are not indicative of any specific class, and we rule out the influence of common features from traditional features extracted by transformer encoder and can get more discriminative features for classification. We apply this method to improve transformer's performance on three public dementia datasets and get improved classification results markedly. Specifically, the method on Pitt datasets gets state-of-the-art (SOTA) result.",

Deep learning (DL) techniques involving fine-tuning large numbers of model parameters have delivered impressive performance on the task of discriminating between language produced by cognitively healthy individuals, and those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). However, questions remain about their ability to generalize beyond the small reference sets that are publicly available for research. As an alternative to fitting model parameters directly, we propose a novel method by which a Transformer DL model (GPT-2) pre-trained on general English text is paired with an artificially degraded version of itself (GPT-D), to compute the ratio between these two models\u2019 perplexities on language from cognitively healthy and impaired individuals. This technique approaches state-of-the-art performance on text data from a widely used \u201cCookie Theft\u201d picture description task, and unlike established alternatives also generalizes well to spontaneous conversations. Furthermore, GPT-D generates text with characteristics known to be associated with AD, demonstrating the induction of dementia-related linguistic anomalies. Our study is a step toward better understanding of the relationships between the inner workings of generative neural language models, the language that they produce, and the deleterious effects of dementia on human speech and language characteristics.",

Background Alzheimer\u2019s disease has become one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide, which seriously affects the health of the elderly. Early detection and intervention are the most effective prevention methods currently. Compared with traditional detection methods such as traditional scale tests, electroencephalograms, and magnetic resonance imaging, speech analysis is more convenient for automatic large-scale Alzheimer\u2019s disease detection and has attracted extensive attention from researchers. In particular, deep learning-based speech analysis and language processing techniques for Alzheimer\u2019s disease detection have been studied and achieved impressive results. Methods To integrate the latest research progresses, hundreds of relevant papers from ACM, DBLP, IEEE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science electronic databases, and other sources were retrieved. We used these keywords for paper search: (Alzheimer OR dementia OR cognitive impairment) AND (speech OR voice OR audio) AND (deep learning OR neural network). Conclusions Fifty-two papers were finally retained after screening. We reviewed and presented the speech databases, deep learning methods, and model performances of these studies. In the end, we pointed out the mainstreams and limitations in the current studies and provided a direction for future research.",

        "abstract": "This work investigates data augmentation techniques for the task of AD detection and performs an empirical evaluation of the different approaches on two kinds of models for both the text and audio domains, using a transformer-based model for both domains. Dementia is a growing problem as our society ages, and detection methods are often invasive and expensive. Recent deep-learning techniques can offer a faster diagnosis and have shown promising results. However, they require large amounts of la-belled data which is not easily available for the task of dementia detection. One effective solution to sparse data problems is data augmentation, though the exact methods need to be selected carefully. To date, there has been no empirical study of data augmentation on Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) datasets for NLP and speech processing. In this work, we investigate data augmentation techniques for the task of AD detection and perform an empirical evaluation of the different approaches on two kinds of models for both the text and audio domains. We use a transformer-based model for both domains, and SVM and Random Forest models for the text and audio domains, respectively. We generate additional samples using traditional as well as deep learning based methods and show that data augmentation improves performance for both the text- and audio-based models and that such results are comparable to state-of-the-art results on the popular ADReSS set, with carefully crafted architectures and features 1 .",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to detect early signs of dementia in patients using English speech transcript files using considerable deep learning and natural language processing techniques like GloVe, Word 2Vec, Doc2Vec word embeddings and LSTM, BiLSTM and GRU, BERT, RoBERTa and ALBERT. The applications of artificial intelligence are increasing day by day. The world is transformed by AI technologies like automated systematic processes and virtual assistance. Dementia is a disorder that causes disintegration in the mental capacity of an individual. This is not a disease but a group of symptoms caused by various other conditions and is common in older people. Detecting dementia in the early stages will reduce complications and provide access to medical attention and medications. Dementia is detected in patients by examining their ability to think, communicate and their physical movements. This is done by performing numerous physical and mental status exams. This paper aims to detect early signs of dementia in patients using English speech transcript files. The proposed models employ considerable deep learning and natural language processing techniques like GloVe, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec word embeddings and LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, BERT, RoBERTa and ALBERT. The models were trained using the Pitt Corpus from the DementiaBank dataset. The best accuracy obtained was 0.812 using the BERT+BilSTM model, and the best F1 score obtained was 0.81 by the ALBERT+BiLSTM model.",

        "abstract": "The proposed model can qualitatively select informative words and sentences using attention layers, and this method also provides good inspiration for AD diagnosis based on implicit sentiment transcripts. Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is difficult to diagnose on the basis of language because of the implicit emotion of transcripts, which is defined as a supervised fuzzy implicit emotion classification at the document level. Recent neural network-based approaches have not paid attention to the implicit sentiments entailed in AD transcripts. Method A two-level attention mechanism is proposed to detect deep semantic information toward words and sentences, which enables it to attend to more words and fewer sentences differentially when constructing document representation. Specifically, a document vector was built by progressively aggregating important words into sentence vectors and important sentences into document vectors. Results Experimental results showed that our method achieved the best accuracy of 91.6% on annotated public Pitt corpora, which validates its effectiveness in learning implicit sentiment representation for our model. Conclusion The proposed model can qualitatively select informative words and sentences using attention layers, and this method also provides good inspiration for AD diagnosis based on implicit sentiment transcripts.",

        "abstract": "This study introduced an optimized vision transformer architecture to predict the group membership by separating healthy adults, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer\u2019s\u2019 brains within the same age group using resting-state functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging data. Advances in applied machine learning techniques for neuroimaging have encouraged scientists to implement models to diagnose brain disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease at early stages. Predicting the exact stage of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is challenging; however, complex deep learning techniques can manage this with precision. While successful, these complex architectures are difficult to interrogate and computationally expensive. Therefore, using novel, simpler architectures with more efficient pattern extraction capabilities, such as transformers, is of interest to neuroscientists. This study introduced an optimized vision transformer architecture to predict the group membership by separating healthy adults, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer\u2019s\u2019 brains within the same age group (>75 years) using resting-state functional (rs-fMRI) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data. Our optimized architecture known as OViTAD is currently the sole vision transformer-based end-to-end pipeline and outperformed the existing transformer models and most state-of-the-art solutions. Our model achieved F1-scores of 97%\u00b10.0 and 99.55%\u00b10.39 from the testing sets for the rs-fMRI and sMRI modalities in the triple-class prediction experiments. Furthermore, our model reached these performances using 30% fewer parameters than a vanilla transformer. The model was robust and repeatable, producing similar estimates across three runs (we reported the averaged evaluation metrics). Finally, to challenge the model, we observed how it handled increasing noise levels by inserting varying numbers of healthy brains into the two dementia groups. Our findings suggest that optimized vision transformers are a promising and exciting new approach for neuroimaging applications, especially for Alzheimer\u2019s disease prediction.",

        "abstract": "The current state-of-the-art in AD diagnosis using deep learning is reviewed, including the most recent trends and findings using a thorough literature review. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), the most familiar type of dementia, is a severe concern in modern healthcare. Around 5.5 million people aged 65 and above have AD, and it is the sixth leading cause of mortality in the US. AD is an irreversible, degenerative brain disorder characterized by a loss of cognitive function and has no proven cure. Deep learning techniques have gained popularity in recent years, particularly in the domains of natural language processing and computer vision. Since 2014, these techniques have begun to achieve substantial consideration in AD diagnosis research, and the number of papers published in this arena is rising drastically. Deep learning techniques have been reported to be more accurate for AD diagnosis in comparison to conventional machine learning models. Motivated to explore the potential of deep learning in AD diagnosis, this study reviews the current state-of-the-art in AD diagnosis using deep learning. We summarize the most recent trends and findings using a thorough literature review. The study also explores the different biomarkers and datasets for AD diagnosis. Even though deep learning has shown promise in AD diagnosis, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed.",

        "abstract": "A cross-language Alzheimer\u2019s disease classifier based on spontaneous speech, which is an end-to-end deep learning model able to achieve better results than manual and semi-automatic approaches is proposed. Life expectancy increased globally, and the increasing prevalence of age-related issues is a major societal challenge. In particular, the World Health organisation estimates that people suffering from dementia worldwide will grow up to 150 million by mid-century. Current pharmacologic treatments are only symptomatic, and therapies are ineffective to slow down or cure the degenerative process. An automatic and standardised tool for early screening of the signals of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is thereby of the utmost importance to rapidly respond. Recently literature suggests that language impairment is a promising sign to reveal early signs of cognitive decline. However, most of the proposed methods require manual activities to extract language features resulting in not scalable, non-standardised and time-consuming screening tools. In this paper, we propose a cross-language Alzheimer\u2019s disease classifier based on spontaneous speech, which is an end-to-end deep learning model able to achieve better results than manual and semi-automatic approaches. In particular, we investigated the capability of our method to achieve good classification results regardless of the language used for the training of the model. To evaluate the method, we used the English audio files of the Pitt Corpus from DementiaBank with 180 subjects: 43 healthy controls subjects and 137 Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients, and the Italian audio files from 96 subjects: 48 healthy controls subjects and 48 Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients. The proposed method obtained good classification results with an accuracy of 93.30% and 90.57%, respectively, for the English and Italian languages separately. Moreover, the classifier achieved good results when training and testing languages differ, obtaining an accuracy of 89.89%, using the English language for training the network and the Italian language for testing, and 89.32% vice-versa.",

        "abstract": "A pre-training framework is introduced that enables a granular and comprehensive understanding of how relational structure can be induced, and empirically demonstrates its advantages by showing that it outperforms existing pre- training state-of-the-art methods. Language model pre-training and the derived general-purpose methods have reshaped machine learning research. However, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding why pre-training improves the performance of downstream tasks. This challenge is pronounced when using language model pre-training in domains outside of natural language. Here we investigate this problem by analysing how pre-training methods impose relational structure in induced per-sample latent spaces\u2014that is, what constraints do pre-training methods impose on the distance or geometry between the pre-trained embeddings of samples. A comprehensive review of pre-training methods reveals that this question remains open, despite theoretical analyses showing the importance of understanding this form of induced structure. Based on this review, we introduce a pre-training framework that enables a granular and comprehensive understanding of how relational structure can be induced. We present a theoretical analysis of the framework from the first principles and establish a connection between the relational inductive bias of pre-training and fine-tuning performance. Empirical studies spanning three data modalities and ten fine-tuning tasks confirm theoretical analyses, inform the design of novel pre-training methods and establish consistent improvements over a compelling suite of methods. Designing methods to induce explicit and deep structural constraints in latent space at the sample level is an open problem in natural language processing-derived methods relying on transfer learning. McDermott and colleagues propose and analyse a pre-training framework imposing such structural constraints, and empirically demonstrate its advantages by showing that it outperforms existing pre-training state-of-the-art methods.",

Neural language representation models such as BERT pre-trained on large-scale corpora can well capture rich semantic patterns from plain text, and be fine-tuned to consistently improve the performance of various NLP tasks. However, the existing pre-trained language models rarely consider incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which can provide rich structured knowledge facts for better language understanding. We argue that informative entities in KGs can enhance language representation with external knowledge. In this paper, we utilize both large-scale textual corpora and KGs to train an enhanced language representation model (ERNIE), which can take full advantage of lexical, syntactic, and knowledge information simultaneously. The experimental results have demonstrated that ERNIE achieves significant improvements on various knowledge-driven tasks, and meanwhile is comparable with the state-of-the-art model BERT on other common NLP tasks.

        "abstract": "A new language representation model, BERT, designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers, which can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks. We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

        "abstract": "This work introduces the knowledge graph language model (KGLM), a neural language model with mechanisms for selecting and copying facts from a knowledge graph that are relevant to the context that enable the model to render information it has never seen before, as well as generate out-of-vocabulary tokens. Modeling human language requires the ability to not only generate fluent text but also encode factual knowledge. However, traditional language models are only capable of remembering facts seen at training time, and often have difficulty recalling them. To address this, we introduce the knowledge graph language model (KGLM), a neural language model with mechanisms for selecting and copying facts from a knowledge graph that are relevant to the context. These mechanisms enable the model to render information it has never seen before, as well as generate out-of-vocabulary tokens. We also introduce the Linked WikiText-2 dataset, a corpus of annotated text aligned to the Wikidata knowledge graph whose contents (roughly) match the popular WikiText-2 benchmark. In experiments, we demonstrate that the KGLM achieves significantly better performance than a strong baseline language model. We additionally compare different language model\u2019s ability to complete sentences requiring factual knowledge, showing that the KGLM outperforms even very large language models in generating facts.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes to enhance learning models with world knowledge in the form of Knowledge Graph (KG) fact triples for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks by introducing a convolution-based model for learning representations of knowledge graph entity and relation clusters in order to reduce the attention space. Machine Learning has been the quintessential solution for many AI problems, but learning models are heavily dependent on specific training data. Some learning models can be incorporated with prior knowledge using a Bayesian setup, but these learning models do not have the ability to access any organized world knowledge on demand. In this work, we propose to enhance learning models with world knowledge in the form of Knowledge Graph (KG) fact triples for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Our aim is to develop a deep learning model that can extract relevant prior support facts from knowledge graphs depending on the task using attention mechanism. We introduce a convolution-based model for learning representations of knowledge graph entity and relation clusters in order to reduce the attention space. We show that the proposed method is highly scalable to the amount of prior information that has to be processed and can be applied to any generic NLP task. Using this method we show significant improvement in performance for text classification with 20Newsgroups (News20) & DBPedia datasets, and natural language inference with Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset. We also demonstrate that a deep learning model can be trained with substantially less amount of labeled training data, when it has access to organized world knowledge in the form of a knowledge base.",

        "abstract": "A unified model for Knowledge Embedding and Pre-trained LanguagERepresentation (KEPLER), which can not only better integrate factual knowledge into PLMs but also produce effective text-enhanced KE with the strong PLMs is proposed. Abstract Pre-trained language representation models (PLMs) cannot well capture factual knowledge from text. In contrast, knowledge embedding (KE) methods can effectively represent the relational facts in knowledge graphs (KGs) with informative entity embeddings, but conventional KE models cannot take full advantage of the abundant textual information. In this paper, we propose a unified model for Knowledge Embedding and Pre-trained LanguagERepresentation (KEPLER), which can not only better integrate factual knowledge into PLMs but also produce effective text-enhanced KE with the strong PLMs. In KEPLER, we encode textual entity descriptions with a PLM as their embeddings, and then jointly optimize the KE and language modeling objectives. Experimental results show that KEPLER achieves state-of-the-art performances on various NLP tasks, and also works remarkably well as an inductive KE model on KG link prediction. Furthermore, for pre-training and evaluating KEPLER, we construct Wikidata5M1 , a large-scale KG dataset with aligned entity descriptions, and benchmark state-of-the-art KE methods on it. It shall serve as a new KE benchmark and facilitate the research on large KG, inductive KE, and KG with text. The source code can be obtained from https://github.com/THU-KEG/KEPLER.",

        "abstract": "A structure-aware scale-adaptive feature selection method for efficient and accurate cancer segmentation based on a segmentation network with a popular encoder-decoder architecture and a structural similarity metric is proposed for better tissue structure awareness to deal with small region segmentation. Cancer segmentation in whole-slide images is a fundamental step for viable tumour burden estimation, which is of great value for cancer assessment. However, factors like vague boundaries or small regions dissociated from viable tumour areas make it a challenging task. Considering the usefulness of multi-scale features in various vision-related tasks, we present a structure-aware scale-adaptive feature selection method for efficient and accurate cancer segmentation. Based on a segmentation network with a popular encoder-decoder architecture, a scaleadaptive module is proposed for selecting more robust features to represent the vague, non-rigid boundaries. Furthermore, a structural similarity metric is proposed for better tissue structure awareness to deal with small region segmentation. In addition, advanced designs including several attention mechanisms and the selective-kernel convolutions are applied to the baseline network for comparative study purposes. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed structure-aware scale-adaptive networks achieve outstanding performance on liver cancer segmentation when compared to top ten submitted results in the challenge of PAIP 2019. Further evaluation on colorectal cancer segmentation shows that the scale-adaptive module improves the baseline network or outperforms the other excellent designs of attention mechanisms when considering the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy.

In some of object recognition problems, labeled data may not be available for all categories. Zero-shot learning utilizes auxiliary information (also called signatures) describing each category in order to find a classifier that can recognize samples from categories with no labeled instance. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised zero-shot learning method that works on an embedding space corresponding to abstract deep visual features. We seek a linear transformation on signatures to map them onto the visual features, such that the mapped signatures of the seen classes are close to labeled samples of the corresponding classes and unlabeled data are also close to the mapped signatures of one of the unseen classes. \nWe use the idea that the rich deep visual features provide a representation space in which samples of each class are usually condensed in a cluster. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through extensive experiments on four public benchmarks improving the state-of-the-art prediction accuracy on three of them.",

        "abstract": "Computational psychiatry recently established itself as a new tool in the study of mental disorders and problems. Integration of different levels of analysis is creating computational phenotypes with clinical and research values, and constructing a way to arrive at precision psychiatry are part of this new branch. It conceptualizes the brain as a computational organ that receives from the environment parameters to respond to challenges through calculations and algorithms in continuous feedback and feedforward loops with a permanent degree of uncertainty. Through this conception, one can seize an understanding of the cerebral and mental processes in the form of theories or hypotheses based on data. Using these approximations, a better understanding of the disorder and its different determinant factors facilitates the diagnostics and treatment by having an individual, ecologic, and holistic approach. It is a tool that can be used to homologate and integrate multiple sources of information given by several theoretical models. In conclusion, it helps psychiatry achieve precision and reproducibility, which can help the mental health field achieve significant advancement. This article is a narrative review of the basis of the functioning of computational psychiatry with a critical analysis of its concepts.",

Alzheimers disease is an irreversible brain disease that slowly destroys memory skills andthinking skills leading to the need for full-time care. Early detection of Alzheimer\u2019s dis-ease is fundamental to slow down the progress of the disease.

We are exploring the effects of the introduction of an attention mechanism on both our model and the actual state of the art.

Automatic text simplification systems help to reduce textual information barriers on the internet. However, for languages other than English, only few parallel data to train these systems exists. We propose a two-step approach to overcome this data scarcity issue. First, we fine-tuned language models on a corpus of German Easy Language, a specific style of German. Then, we used these models as decoders in a sequence-to-sequence simplification task. We show that the language models adapt to the style characteristics of Easy Language and output more accessible texts. Moreover, with the style-specific pre-training, we reduced the number of trainable parameters in text simplification models. Hence, less parallel data is sufficient for training. Our results indicate that pre-training on unaligned data can reduce the required parallel data while improving the performance on downstream tasks.",

        "abstract": "A systematic comparison across different modalities, granularities and machine learning models to guide in choosing the most effective tools for the automatic detection of Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia from recordings of spontaneous speech finds that text-based classification outperformed audio- based classification with the best performance attaining 88.7%, surpassing other reports to-date relying on the same dataset. Automated techniques to detect Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia through the use of audio recordings of spontaneous speech are now available with varying degrees of reliability. Here, we present a systematic comparison across different modalities, granularities and machine learning models to guide in choosing the most effective tools. Specifically, we present a multi-modal approach (audio and text) for the automatic detection of Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia from recordings of spontaneous speech. Sixteen features, including four feature extraction methods (Energy\u2013Time plots, Keg of Text Analytics, Keg of Text Analytics-Extended and Speech to Silence ratio) not previously applied in this context were tested to determine their relative performance. These features encompass two modalities (audio vs. text) at two resolution scales (frame-level vs. file-level). We compared the accuracy resulting from these features and found that text-based classification outperformed audio-based classification with the best performance attaining 88.7%, surpassing other reports to-date relying on the same dataset. For text-based classification in particular, the best file-level feature performed 9.8% better than the frame-level feature. However, when comparing audio-based classification, the best frame-level feature performed 1.4% better than the best file-level feature. This multi-modal multi-model comparison at high- and low-resolution offers insights into which approach is most efficacious, depending on the sampling context. Such a comparison of the accuracy of Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia classification using both frame-level and file-level granularities on audio and text modalities of different machine learning models on the same dataset has not been previously addressed. We also demonstrate that the subject\u2019s speech captured in short time frames and their dynamics may contain enough inherent information to indicate the presence of dementia. Overall, such a systematic analysis facilitates the identification of Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia quickly and non-invasively, potentially leading to more timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.",

        "abstract": "This work addresses the class imbalance problem in the SD domain via a multi-branching (MB) scheme and by weighting the contribution of classes in the overall loss function, resulting in a huge improvement in stuttering classes on the SEP-28 k dataset over the baseline (<italic>StutterNet</italic). Stuttering is a neuro-developmental speech impairment characterized by uncontrolled utterances (interjections) and core behaviors (blocks, repetitions, and prolongations), and is caused by the failure of speech sensorimotors. Due to its complex nature, stuttering detection (SD) is a difficult task. If detected at an early stage, it could facilitate speech therapists to observe and rectify the speech patterns of persons who stutter (PWS). The stuttered speech of PWS is usually available in limited amounts and is highly imbalanced. To this end, we address the class imbalance problem in the SD domain via a multi-branching (MB) scheme and by weighting the contribution of classes in the overall loss function, resulting in a huge improvement in stuttering classes on the SEP-28 k dataset over the baseline (<italic>StutterNet</italic>). To tackle data scarcity, we investigate the effectiveness of data augmentation on top of a multi-branched training scheme. The augmented training outperforms the MB <italic>StutterNet</italic> (clean) by a relative margin of 4.18% in macro F1-score (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {F}_{1}$</tex-math></inline-formula>).

Finally, we have shown that applying data augmentation in the cross-corpora scenario can improve the overall SD performance by a relative margin of 13.23% in <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathcal {F}_{1}$</tex-math></inline-formula> over the clean training.",

        "abstract": "Transformer-based deep learning models were applied to automatically extract linguistic features for identifying individuals with dementia to suggest the potential possibility of a more flexible examination setting, casual semi-structured individual or group interview, for detecting incoherent or illogical thoughts and speech in patients with dementia. Dementia is a disease characterized by cognitive impairment that leads to incoherent or illogical thoughts and speech. There are attempts to identify dementia through speech analyses, but there is a dearth of research on casual conversation analysis. This work examined communication impairment detection of people with early-stage memory loss, including mild dementia and mild cognitive impairment. The data sets included semi-structured interviews from two studies conducted at the University of Washington (UW), the DementiaBank\u2019s Pitt Corpus, and the ADReSS Challenge at INTERSPEECH 2020. We applied Transformer-based deep learning models to automatically extract linguistic features for identifying individuals with dementia. Our results showed the models\u2019 abilities on detecting linguistic deficits with the best mean F1-score of 76% on the Pitt Corpus, 84% on the ADReSS, 90% on the augmented ADReSS, and 74% on the UW transcripts. The results suggest the potential possibility of a more flexible examination setting, casual semi-structured individual or group interview, for detecting incoherent or illogical thoughts and speech in patients with dementia.",

        "abstract": "An automatic speech analysis framework to identify AD subjects from short narrative speech transcript elicited with a picture description task and obtained state-of-the-art cross-validation accuracy of 97 in distinguishing individuals with AD from elderly normal controls is proposed. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of death in the world and affects at least 50 million individuals. Currently, there is no cure for the disease. So a convenient and reliable early detection approach before irreversible brain damage and cognitive decline have occurred is of great importance. One prominent sign of AD is language dysfunction. Some aspects of language are affected at the same time or even before the memory problems emerge. Therefore, we propose an automatic speech analysis framework to identify AD subjects from short narrative speech transcript elicited with a picture description task. The proposed network is based on attention mechanism and is composed of a CNN and a GRU module. We obtained state-of-the-art cross-validation accuracy of 97 in distinguishing individuals with AD from elderly normal controls. The performance of our model makes it reasonable to conclude that our approach reveals a considerable part of the language deficits of AD patients and can help with the diagnosis of the disease from spontaneous speech.",

        "abstract": "This study looks at the influence of disharmony between batch normalization and dropout techniques on the early diagnosis of AD and suggests that using little or none at all leads to better-performing designs. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a global health issue that predominantly affects older people. It affects one\u2019s daily activities by modifying neural networks in the brain. AD is categorized by the death of neurons, the creation of amyloid plaques, and the development of neurofibrillary tangles. In clinical settings, an early diagnosis of AD is critical to limit the problems associated with it and can be accomplished using neuroimaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). Deep learning (DL) techniques are widely used in computer vision and related disciplines for various tasks such as classification, segmentation, detection, etc. CNN is a sort of DL architecture, which is normally useful to categorize and extract data in the spatial and frequency domains for image-based applications. Batch normalization and dropout are commonly deployed elements of modern CNN architectures. Due to the internal covariance shift between batch normalization and dropout, the models perform sub-optimally under diverse scenarios. This study looks at the influence of disharmony between batch normalization and dropout techniques on the early diagnosis of AD. We looked at three different scenarios: (1) no dropout but batch normalization, (2) a single dropout layer in the network right before the softmax layer, and (3) a convolutional layer between a dropout layer and a batch normalization layer. We investigated three binaries: mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs. normal control (NC), AD vs. NC, AD vs. MCI, one multiclass AD vs. NC vs. MCI classification problem using PET modality, as well as one binary AD vs. NC classification problem using MRI modality. In comparison to using a large value of dropout, our findings suggest that using little or none at all leads to better-performing designs.",

        "abstract": "This paper demonstrates the predictive power of several speech features derived from remotely collected audio used for common clinical cognitive testing, and investigates the capability of speech features, estimated from paragraph-recall and animal fluency test speech, to predict clinical CI assessment. Remote, automated cognitive impairment (CI) diagnosis has the potential to facilitate care for the elderly. Speech is easily collected over the phone and already some common cognitive tests are administered remotely, resulting in regular audio data collections. Speech-based CI diagnosis leveraging existing audio is therefore an attractive approach for remote elderly cognitive health monitoring. In this paper, we demonstrate the predictive power of several speech features derived from remotely collected audio used for common clinical cognitive testing. Specifically, using phoneme-based measures, pseudo-syllable rate, pitch variance, and articulatory coordination derived from formant cross-correlation measures, we investigate the capability of speech features, estimated from paragraph-recall and animal fluency test speech, to predict clinical CI assessment. Using a database consisting of audio from elderly subjects collected over a 4 year period, we develop support vector machine classification models of the CI clinical assessments. The best performing models result in an average equal error rate (EER) of 13.5%.",

        "abstract": "A novel pre-training scheme called PLUS, which stands for Protein sequence representations Learned Using Structural information, which consists of masked language modeling and a complementary protein-specific pre- training task, namely same family prediction that can be used to pre-train various model architectures. Bridging the exponentially growing gap between the numbers of unlabeled and labeled protein sequences, several studies adopted semi-supervised learning for protein sequence modeling. In these studies, models were pre-trained with a substantial amount of unlabeled data, and the representations were transferred to various downstream tasks. Most pre-training methods solely rely on language modeling and often exhibit limited performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel pre-training scheme called PLUS, which stands for Protein sequence representations Learned Using Structural information. PLUS consists of masked language modeling and a complementary protein-specific pre-training task, namely same-family prediction. PLUS can be used to pre-train various model architectures. In this work, we use PLUS to pre-train a bidirectional recurrent neural network and refer to the resulting model as PLUS-RNN. Our experiment results demonstrate that PLUS-RNN outperforms other models of similar size solely pre-trained with the language modeling in six out of seven widely used protein biology tasks. Furthermore, we present the results from our qualitative interpretation analyses to illustrate the strengths of PLUS-RNN. PLUS provides a novel way to exploit evolutionary relationships among unlabeled proteins and is broadly applicable across a variety of protein biology tasks. We expect that the gap between the numbers of unlabeled and labeled proteins will continue to grow exponentially, and the proposed pre-training method will play a larger role.

        "abstract": "This work proposes a knowledge-enabled language representation model (K-BERT) with knowledge graphs (KGs), in which triples are injected into the sentences as domain knowledge, which significantly outperforms BERT and reveals promising results in twelve NLP tasks. Pre-trained language representation models, such as BERT, capture a general language representation from large-scale corpora, but lack domain-specific knowledge. When reading a domain text, experts make inferences with relevant knowledge. For machines to achieve this capability, we propose a knowledge-enabled language representation model (K-BERT) with knowledge graphs (KGs), in which triples are injected into the sentences as domain knowledge. However, too much knowledge incorporation may divert the sentence from its correct meaning, which is called knowledge noise (KN) issue. To overcome KN, K-BERT introduces soft-position and visible matrix to limit the impact of knowledge. K-BERT can easily inject domain knowledge into the models by being equipped with a KG without pre-training by itself because it is capable of loading model parameters from the pre-trained BERT. Our investigation reveals promising results in twelve NLP tasks. Especially in domain-specific tasks (including finance, law, and medicine), K-BERT significantly outperforms BERT, which demonstrates that K-BERT is an excellent choice for solving the knowledge-driven problems that require experts.",

        "abstract": "A new architecture, the Poly-encoder, is developed that is designed to approach the performance of the Cross-encoders while maintaining reasonable computation time and achieves state-of-the-art results on both dialogue tasks. The use of deep pretrained bidirectional transformers has led to remarkable progress in learning multi-sentence representations for downstream language understanding tasks (Devlin et al., 2018). For tasks that make pairwise comparisons, e.g. matching a given context with a corresponding response, two approaches have permeated the literature. A Cross-encoder performs full self-attention over the pair; a Bi-encoder performs self-attention for each sequence separately, and the final representation is a function of the pair. While Cross-encoders nearly always outperform Bi-encoders on various tasks, both in our work and others' (Urbanek et al., 2019), they are orders of magnitude slower, which hampers their ability to perform real-time inference. In this work, we develop a new architecture, the Poly-encoder, that is designed to approach the performance of the Cross-encoder while maintaining reasonable computation time. Additionally, we explore two pretraining schemes with different datasets to determine how these affect the performance on our chosen dialogue tasks: ConvAI2 and DSTC7 Track 1. We show that our models achieve state-of-the-art results on both tasks; that the Poly-encoder is a suitable replacement for Bi-encoders and Cross-encoders; and that even better results can be obtained by pretraining on a large dialogue dataset.",

        "abstract": "A triple-style negative sampling in a batch of data can signi\ufb01cantly increase the proportion of negative sampling while retaining the training time almost unchanged, and a new data augmentation method utilizing the inverse relationship of triples is proposed to improve the performance and robustness of the model. \u2014Semantic networks, such as the knowledge graph, can represent the knowledge leveraging the graph structure. Although the knowledge graph shows promising values in natural language processing, it suffers from incompleteness. This paper focuses on knowledge graph completion by predicting linkage be- tween entities, which is a fundamental yet critical task. Semantic matching is a potential solution for link prediction as it can deal with unseen entities, while the translational distance based methods struggle with the unseen entities. However, to achieve competitive performance as translational distance based methods, semantic matching based methods require large-scale datasets for the training purpose, which are typically unavailable in practical settings. Therefore, we employ the language model and introduce a novel knowledge graph architecture named LP-BERT, which contains two main stages: multi-task pre-training and knowledge graph \ufb01ne-tuning. In the pre-training phase, three tasks are taken to drive the model to learn the relationship information from triples by predicting either entities or relations. While in the \ufb01ne-tuning phase, inspired by contrastive learning, we design a triple-style negative sampling in a batch, which greatly increases the proportion of negative sampling while keeping the training time almost unchanged. Furthermore, we propose a new data augmentation method utilizing the inverse relationship of triples to improve the performance and robustness of the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conduct extensive experiments on three widely-used knowledge graph datasets, WN18RR, FB15k-237, and UMLS. The experi- mental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods, and our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the WN18RR and FB15k-237 datasets. Signi\ufb01cantly, the Hits@10 indicator is improved by 5% from the previous state-of-the-art result on the WN18RR dataset while reaching 100% on the UMLS dataset. (MRM). Three tasks are trained in parallel, using the multi-task manner. In the \ufb01ne-tuning stage, we design a triple-style negative sampling in a batch of data, which can signi\ufb01cantly increase the proportion of negative sampling while retaining the training time almost unchanged.",

With the emerging branch of incorporating factual knowledge into pre-trained language models such as BERT, most existing models consider shallow, static, and separately pre-trained entity embeddings, which limits the performance gains of these models. Few works explore the potential of deep contextualized knowledge representation when injecting knowledge. In this paper, we propose the Contextualized Language and Knowledge Embedding (CoLAKE), which jointly learns contextualized representation for both language and knowledge with the extended MLM objective. Instead of injecting only entity embeddings, CoLAKE extracts the knowledge context of an entity from large-scale knowledge bases. To handle the heterogeneity of knowledge context and language context, we integrate them in a unified data structure, word-knowledge graph (WK graph). CoLAKE is pre-trained on large-scale WK graphs with the modified Transformer encoder. We conduct experiments on knowledge-driven tasks, knowledge probing tasks, and language understanding tasks. Experimental results show that CoLAKE outperforms previous counterparts on most of the tasks. Besides, CoLAKE achieves surprisingly high performance on our synthetic task called word-knowledge graph completion, which shows the superiority of simultaneously contextualizing language and knowledge representation.",

        "abstract": "A dynamic knowledge integration strategy for NLI, where knowledge from multiple knowledge graphs (KGs) can be dynamically integrated and facilitates the incorporation of PLM, simply by treating the input tokens as a fully connected graph and adapting the PLM outputs as the node embeddings. Natural language inference (NLI) aims to determine the entailment relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. It is a fundamental but difficult problem, since there may exists serious semantic and logistic gap between the premise and the hypothesis. Despite using strong pre-trained language model (PLM), previous work performs poorly on complicated reasoning for knowledge-sensitive cases ignoring the integration of external knowledge. We propose a dynamic knowledge integration strategy for NLI, where knowledge from multiple knowledge graphs (KGs) can be dynamically integrated. For each KG, it transforms input tokens into a graph according to the connectivity of the related entities. All the graphs are encoded by a group of parallel graph neural networks (GNNs), and after each layer the intermediate results are integrated dynamically by being conditioned on the input text. This strategy also facilitates the incorporation of PLM, simply by treating the input tokens as a fully connected graph and adapting the PLM outputs as the node embeddings. Experiments on SNLI, MNLI and SciTail show that, the dynamic integration of knowledge from WordNet and ConceptNet achieves significant improvements over the strongest baseline built upon RoBERTa.",

        "abstract": "This work distills a generic architecture of a neural EL system and discusses its components, such as candidate generation, mention-context encoding, and entity ranking, summarizing prominent methods for each of them. This survey presents a comprehensive description of recent neural entity linking (EL) systems developed since 2015 as a result of the \u201cdeep learning revolution\u201d in natural language processing. Its goal is to systemize design features of neural entity linking systems and compare their performance to the remarkable classic methods on common benchmarks. This work distills a generic architecture of a neural EL system and discusses its components, such as candidate generation, mention-context encoding, and entity ranking, summarizing prominent methods for each of them. The vast variety of modifications of this general architecture are grouped by several common themes: joint entity mention detection and disambiguation, models for global linking, domain-independent techniques including zero-shot and distant supervision methods, and cross-lingual approaches. Since many neural models take advantage of entity and mention/context embeddings to represent their meaning, this work also overviews prominent entity embedding techniques. Finally, the survey touches on applications of entity linking, focusing on the recently emerged use-case of enhancing deep pre-trained masked language models based on the Transformer architecture.",

        "abstract": "A novel method for brain tumor segmentation in MR images based on fully-connected CRF (FC-CRF) model that establishes pairwise potentials on all pairs of pixels in the images. Grid conditional random fields (CRFs) are widely applied in both natural and medical image segmentation tasks. However, they only consider the label coherence in neighborhood pixels or regions, which limits their ability to model long-range connections within the image and generally results in excessive smoothing of tumor boundaries. In this paper, we present a novel method for brain tumor segmentation in MR images based on fully-connected CRF (FC-CRF) model that establishes pairwise potentials on all pairs of pixels in the images. We employ a hierarchical approach to differentiate different structures of tumor and further formulate a FC-CRF model with learned data-driven prior knowledge of tumor core. The methods were evaluated on the testing and leaderboard set of Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS) 2013 challenge. The precision of segmented tumor boundaries is improved significantly and the results are competitive compared to the start-of-the-arts.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a method named Adaptive Embedding ZSL (AEZSL) to learn an adaptive visual-semantic mapping for each unseen category based on the similarities between each unseen categories and all the seen categories, and makes two extensions based on this method. Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) aims to classify a test instance from an unseen category based on the training instances from seen categories, in which the gap between seen categories and unseen categories is generally bridged via visual-semantic mapping between the low-level visual feature space and the intermediate semantic space. However, the visual-semantic mapping learnt based on seen categories may not generalize well to unseen categories because the data distributions between seen categories and unseen categories are considerably different, which is known as the projection domain shift problem in ZSL. To address this domain shift issue, we propose a method named Adaptive Embedding ZSL (AEZSL) to learn an adaptive visual-semantic mapping for each unseen category based on the similarities between each unseen category and all the seen categories. Then, we further make two extensions based on our AEZSL method. Firstly, in order to utilize the unlabeled test instances from unseen categories, we extend our AEZSL to a semi-supervised approach named AEZSL with Label Refinement (AEZSL_LR), in which a progressive approach is developed to update the visual classifiers and refine the predicted test labels alternatively based on the similarities among test instances and among unseen categories. Secondly, to avoid learning visual-semantic mapping for each unseen category in the large-scale classification task, we extend our AEZSL to a deep adaptive embedding model named Deep AEZSL (DAEZSL) sharing the similar idea (i.e., visual-semantic mapping should be category-specific and related to the semantic space) with AEZSL, which only needs to be trained once, but can be applied to arbitrary number of unseen categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve the state-of-the-art results for image classification on four benchmark datasets.",

        "title": "The Two Cultures of Computational Psychiatry.",
        "abstract": "The dual cultures of computational psychiatry share an overlapping set of statistical tools and practical methods but differ in whether the end goal is explanation or prediction, as well as limiting the inferences that each culture can draw. Computational psychiatry is a rapidly growing field that uses tools from cognitive science, computational neuroscience, and machine learning to address difficult psychiatric questions. Its great promise is that these tools will improve psychiatric diagnosis and treatment while also helping to explain the causes of psychiatric illness.1-3 Within computational psychiatry, there are distinct research cultures with distinct computational tools and research goals: machine learning and explanatory modeling.1 While each can potentially advance psychiatric research, important distinctions between the cultures sometimes go unappreciated in the broader psychiatric research community. We detail these distinctions, referring to Breiman\u2019s influential dichotomy between these cultures of statistical modeling4 to identify limitations on the inferences that each culture can draw. Breiman4 defined the 2 cultures of statistical modeling in terms of a data-generating process that generates output data from input variables. His dichotomy distinguished \u201calgorithmic modeling,\u201d4(p200) which aims to predict what outputs a data-generating process will produce from a given set of inputs while treating the process itself as a black box,2,3 from \u201cdata modeling,\u201d4(p199) which uses the pattern of outputs and inputs to explain how the data-generating process works. In psychiatry, the data-generating processes are the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms that produce psychiatric illnesses. The output data produced by these processes are psychiatric outcomes (eg, symptoms, medication response) with input variables including family history, precipitating life events, and others. Breiman\u2019s distinction between prediction and explanation is also what separates machine-learning approaches to computational psychiatry, which aim to predict psychiatric outcomes, from explanatory modeling, which aims to explain the computational-biological mechanisms of psychiatric illnesses. While these approaches have also been termed data-driven and theory-driven,1 we emphasize that the dual cultures of computational psychiatry share an overlapping set of statistical tools and practical methods but differ in whether the end goal is explanation or prediction. A deep neural network, for instance, can be either explanatory (as a biophysically realistic model of psychiatric dysfunction), or predictive (as a classifier used to predict a diagnosis), depending on context. The culture of machine learning typically uses statistical techniques, such as support vector machines or deep neural networks, to predict psychiatric outcomes. These tools can be seen as lying on a continuum with classical statistics such as regression but with the addition of practices designed to reduce overfitting, such as parameter regularization and cross validation. For instance, a study by Webb et al5 has used such tools to predict antidepressant response from a combination of variables, including demographic factors, symptom severity, and cognitive task performance. Despite good predictive performance, the study drew no conclusions about the mechanisms by which these variables were linked to antidepressant response. This is because in machine learning, the parameters of the models that are used to predict psychiatric outcomes are not assumed to correspond to any underlying psychological or neural process; consequently, these parameters cannot be interpreted mechanistically. In comparison, the culture of explanatory modeling focuses on statistical models (expressed as equations) that define interacting processes with parameters that putatively correspond to neural computations. For instance, equations describing value updating in reinforcement-learning models are thought to correspond to corticostriatal synaptic modifications modulated by dopaminergic signaling of reward prediction errors. Consequently, explanatory model parameters fit to behavioral and/or neural data from patients with psychiatric diagnoses can directly inform inferences about dysfunctions in underlying neural computations, subject to several conditions being met. For instance, Huys et al6 have shown that anhedonia is correlated across diagnoses with a model parameter corresponding to the blunting of experienced reward value but not with a parameter controlling the rate of learning from this experienced value, providing evidence against one dopaminergic explanation of depression. Importantly, there are several conditions that must be met before an explanatory model can be used in this way. First, to support the model\u2019s correspondence to the true data-generating process and distinguish between different candidate models, the models must make sufficiently different predictions for the experimental data. Separately, to identify the model parameters accurately, the parameters\u2019 effects on model predictions should be relatively independent, and there must be sufficient data. One approach to testing these conditions is to simulate data from each candidate model and test the ability of a model-fitting routine to recover the true cognitive model and its parameters from these data. Because empirical data will not correspond as perfectly to any of the candidate models, this test is a necessary but not sufficient condition for reliable explanatory modeling. Indeed, a common error is to overinterpret results, forgetting that the best-fitting model is only better than models with which it was compared and parameter values are only estimates reliable to a level of statistical error. A potential limitation of explanatory modeling in computational psychiatry is that theories (ie, models) may be ill-matched to available data, because data collected for other purposes may not distinguish between subtly (but importantly) different hypotheses regardVIEWPOINT",

Automatic screening of Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia (AD) can have significant impact on society and the well-being of the patients. Early detection of AD from spontaneous speech offers great po-tential for inexpensive and convenient casual testing. We propose our deep neural network architecture that leverages acoustic, linguistic and demographic features to build a model for dementia screening for the biographic interview speech corpus of Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study on Adult Development and Aging (ILSE). We oversample non-sequential and sequential features using well-known oversampling techniques and adapted data augmentation techniques to overcome the chal-lenge of the imbalanced dataset, since the distribution of the diagnostic groups in ILSE corresponds to the prevalence of dementia. Our system achieves 70 . 6% of unweighted average recall on a 3-class classification problem. Moreover, we also investigate the feature importances to the model prediction to identify the most relevant indicators for AD detection, which may contribute to interpreting signs of cognitive decline and thus supporting clinicians in the diagnosis of dementia.",

Traditionally, Text Simplification is treated as a monolingual translation task where sentences between source texts and their simplified counterparts are aligned for training. However, especially for longer input documents, summarizing the text (or dropping less relevant content altogether) plays an important role in the simplification process, which is currently not reflected in existing datasets. Simultaneously, resources for non-English languages are scarce in general and prohibitive for training new solutions. To tackle this problem, we pose core requirements for a system that can jointly summarize and simplify long source documents. We further describe the creation of a new dataset for joint Text Simplification and Summarization based on German Wikipedia and the German children\u2019s encyclopedia \u201cKlexikon\u201d, consisting of almost 2,900 documents. We release a document-aligned version that particularly highlights the summarization aspect, and provide statistical evidence that this resource is well suited to simplification as well.

        "abstract": "This work proposes to make utilization of multimodal features with speech acoustic and linguistic features for the speech recognition of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with satisfactory recognition effect. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of progressive degenerative dementia, which has a great impact on social economics throughout the world. In the vast majority of cases, AD patients are diagnosed by biochemical analysis, lumbar puncture and advanced imaging examination, which cannot play a preventive role in early stage of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Speech signals contain abundant personal information, especially AD patients always accompany with speech disorder, which provides a potential to utilize speech information to distinguish AD patients from healthy persons. The work presented in this paper aims to develop new approach for early detection of AD by noninvasive methods. We propose to make utilization of multimodal features with speech acoustic and linguistic features for the speech recognition of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Three different kinds of features, IS10_paraling features, deep acoustic using fine-tuned Wav2Vec2.0 model and deep linguistic features extracted using fine-tuned BERT, are adopted for AD classification by SVM classifier. By conducting experiments on two publicly available datasets of NCMMSC2021 and ADReSSo, the experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with satisfactory recognition effect. Our best-performing model obtains the accuracy of 89.1% and 84.0% in the long and short-audio of NCMMSC2021, and 83.7% in ADReSSo, which is promising for the early diagnosis and classification of AD patients.",

        "abstract": "It is shown for the first time that GPT-3 can be utilized to predict dementia from spontaneous speech and text embedding can be reliably used to distinguish individuals with AD from healthy controls and infer the subject\u2019s cognitive testing score. Language impairment is an important biomarker of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly natural language processing (NLP), has recently been increasingly used for early prediction of AD through speech. Yet, relatively few studies exist on using large language models, especially GPT-3, to aid in the early diagnosis of dementia. In this work, we show for the first time that GPT-3 can be utilized to predict dementia from spontaneous speech. Specifically, we leverage the vast semantic knowledge encoded in the GPT-3 model to generate text embedding, a vector representation of the transcribed text from speech, that captures the semantic meaning of the input. We demonstrate that the text embedding can be reliably used to (1) distinguish individuals with AD from healthy controls, and (2) infer the subject\u2019s cognitive testing score, both solely based on speech data. We further show that text embedding considerably outperforms the conventional acoustic feature-based approach and even performs competitively with prevailing fine-tuned models. Together, our results suggest that GPT-3 based text embedding is a viable approach for AD assessment directly from speech and has the potential to improve early diagnosis of dementia.",

        "abstract": "The study employs various Machine Learning models with ensemble learners and Deep Learning models for a comparative analysis to set a proper baseline for further research and advancements in the detection of Alzheimer's disease. Almost 50 million individuals throughout the world suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD), a disease of the nervous system. There are no licensed medications on the market right now that can treat AD or halt its development. There are, however, treatments available that can help mediate AD in earlier stages. This demonstrates the necessity of early diagnosis. One of the notable symptoms of Alzheimer's can be in the patient's cognitive abilities. In daily chores, there is an indication of a diminished capacity for interpreting or producing speech. As a result, natural language processing can be a useful method for analyzing patient speech. Due to the rapid advancements in the field of computer science, we can use NLP to process these speech extracts from AD patients. NLP has a great deal of potential to help individuals who are suffering from mental illnesses receive better care. The study employs various Machine Learning models with ensemble learners and Deep Learning models for a comparative analysis to set a proper baseline for further research and advancements in the detection of Alzheimer's disease.",

        "abstract": "Experimental results on 174 subjects with baseline resting-state functional MRI data from ADNI demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed recurrent neural networkbased learning framework to extract sequential features from dynamic FC networks with rs-fMRI data for brain disease classification. Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) networks based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) can help us understand the function of brain better, and have been applied to brain disease identification, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and its early stages (i.e., mild cognitive impairment, MCI). Deep learning (e.g., convolutional neural network, CNN) methods have been recently applied to dynamic FC network analysis, and achieve good performance compared to traditional machine learning methods. Existing studies usually ignore sequence information of temporal features from dynamic FC networks. To this end, in this paper, we propose a recurrent neural networkbased learning framework to extract sequential features from dynamic FC networks with rs-fMRI data for brain disease classification. Experimental results on 174 subjects with baseline resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data from ADNI demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in binary and multi-category classification tasks.",

        "abstract": "The study develops a novel framework for the identification of different AD stages using pre-trained health data classification models such as the MobileNet and the main advantage of this novel approach is the creation of lightweight neural networks. Background: Alzheimer\u2019s, the predominant formof dementia, is a neurodegenerative brain disorder with no known cure. With the lack of innovative findings to diagnose and treat Alzheimer\u2019s, the number of middle-aged people with dementia is estimated to hike nearly to 13 million by the end of 2050. The estimated cost of Alzheimer\u2019s and other related ailments is USD321 billion in 2022 and can rise above USD1 trillion by the end of 2050. Therefore, the early prediction of such diseases using computer-aided systems is a topic of considerable interest and substantial study among scholars. The major objective is to develop a comprehensive framework for the earliest onset and categorization of different phases of Alzheimer\u2019s. Methods: Experimental work of this novel approach is performed by implementing neural networks (CNN) on MRI image datasets. Five classes of Alzheimer\u2019s disease subjects are multi-classified. We used the transfer learning determinant to reap the benefits of pre-trained health data classification models such as the MobileNet. Results: For the evaluation and comparison of the proposed model, various performance metrics are used. The test results reveal that the CNN architectures method has the following characteristics: appropriate simple structures that mitigate computational burden, memory usage, and overfitting, as well as offering maintainable time. The MobileNet pre-trained model has been fine-tuned and has achieved 96.6 percent accuracy for multi-class AD stage classifications. Other models, such as VGG16 and ResNet50 models, are applied tothe same dataset whileconducting this research, and it is revealed that this model yields better results than other models. Conclusion: The study develops a novel framework for the identification of different AD stages. The main advantage of this novel approach is the creation of lightweight neural networks. MobileNet model is mostly used for mobile applications and was rarely used for medical image analysis; hence, we implemented this model for disease detection andyieldedbetter results than existing models.",

        "abstract": "The stringent validation methodology developed in this paper produces more conservative, and likely, more generalizable performance estimates compared with methodologies used in prior art. Remote-automated cognitive impairment (CI) monitoring has the potential to facilitate care for the elderly with mobility restrictions. In particular, CI detection based on speech features from audio data collected for remote cognitive testing holds significant promise to improve remote cognitive health monitoring. This requires no additional testing for speech analysis and, combined with cognitive test scores, can improve CI detection over using cognitive test scores alone. This paper builds on previous work with an expanded set of speech features extracted from a larger suite of remotely administered cognitive tests. The speech features tested include measures of phoneme characteristics, pitch, and articulation. The relative merits of using speech features, a common cognitive test score, and both combined for CI prediction are also explored. The best performing system uses a combination of speech features and the cognitive test score, obtaining a performance outcome of area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.77. This outcome is better at the 5% significance level than that obtained using the speech features alone (AUC = 0.74) or the cognitive test alone (AUC = 0.54). Additionally, the influence of validation methodology on performance estimation is addressed in detail. Learning statistical models for speech-based CI diagnosis is challenging due to limited availability of audio data from subjects with clinical CI diagnoses. Rigorous validation methods for model learning are important in this context. The stringent validation methodology developed in this paper produces more conservative, and likely, more generalizable performance estimates compared with methodologies used in prior art.",

        "abstract": "The result shows that the proposed method can effectively capture the inter-residue correlations and improves the performance of contact prediction by up to 9% compared to the MLM baseline under the same setting, revealing the potential of the sequence pre-training method to surpass MSA based methods in general. Understanding protein sequences is vital and urgent for biology, healthcare, and medicine. Labeling approaches are expensive yet time-consuming, while the amount of unlabeled data is increasing quite faster than that of the labeled data due to low-cost, high-throughput sequencing methods. In order to extract knowledge from these unlabeled data, representation learning is of significant value for protein-related tasks and has great potential for helping us learn more about protein functions and structures. The key problem in the protein sequence representation learning is to capture the co-evolutionary information reflected by the interresidue co-variation in the sequences. Instead of leveraging multiple sequence alignment as is usually done, we propose a novel method to capture this information directly by pre-training via a dedicated language model, i.e., Pairwise Masked Language Model (PMLM). In a conventional masked language model, the masked tokens (i.e. amino acid residues) are modeled by conditioning on the unmasked tokens only, but processed independently to each other. However, our proposed PMLM takes the dependency among masked tokens into consideration, i.e., the probability of a token pair is not equal to the product of the probability of the two tokens. By applying this model, the pre-trained encoder is able to generate a better representation for protein sequences. Our result shows that the proposed method can effectively capture the inter-residue correlations and improves the performance of contact prediction by up to 9% compared to the MLM baseline under the same setting. The proposed model also significantly outperforms the MSA baseline by more than 7% on the TAPE contact prediction benchmark when pretrained on a subset of the sequence database which the MSA is generated from, revealing the potential of the sequence pre-training method to surpass MSA based methods in general.",

        "abstract": "A novel joint pre-training framework, JAKET, to model both the knowledge graph and language, which enables the pre-trained model to easily adapt to unseen knowledge graphs in new domains. Knowledge graphs (KGs) contain rich information about world knowledge, entities, and relations. Thus, they can be great supplements to existing pre-trained language models. However, it remains a challenge to efficiently integrate information from KG into language modeling. And the understanding of a knowledge graph requires related context. We propose a novel joint pre-training framework, JAKET, to model both the knowledge graph and language. The knowledge module and language module provide essential information to mutually assist each other: the knowledge module produces embeddings for entities in text while the language module generates context-aware initial embeddings for entities and relations in the graph. Our design enables the pre-trained model to easily adapt to unseen knowledge graphs in new domains. Experiment results on several knowledge-aware NLP tasks show that our proposed framework achieves superior performance by effectively leveraging knowledge in language understanding.",

        "abstract": "Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity is presented. BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) has set a new state-of-the-art performance on sentence-pair regression tasks like semantic textual similarity (STS). However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations (~65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT. We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.",

        "abstract": "A framework based on concept co-occurrence for academic idea inspiration, which has been integrated into a research assistant system, has broad prospects and can assist researchers in expediting the process of discovering new ideas. Researchers usually come up with new ideas only after thoroughly comprehending vast quantities of literature. The difficulty of this procedure is exacerbated by the fact that the number of academic publications is growing exponentially. In this study, we devise a framework based on concept co-occurrence for academic idea inspiration, which has been integrated into a research assistant system. From our perspective, the fusion of two concepts that co-occur in an academic paper can be regarded as an important way of the emergence of a new idea. We construct evolving concept graphs according to the co-occurrence relationship of concepts from 20 disciplines or topics. Then we design a temporal link prediction method based on masked language model to explore potential connections between different concepts. To verbalize the newly discovered connections, we also utilize the pretrained language model to generate a description of an idea based on a new data structure called co-occurrence citation quintuple. We evaluate our proposed system using both automatic metrics and human assessment. The results demonstrate that our system has broad prospects and can assist researchers in expediting the process of discovering new ideas.",

        "abstract": "A plug-and-play method for large- scale commonsense integration without pre-training, inspired by the observation that in the regular downstream tasks where no external knowledge was introduced, the variation in the parameters of the language model was minor. We study how to enhance language models (LMs) with tex- tual commonsense knowledge. Previous work (e.g., KnowBERT) has focused on the integrating entity knowledge from knowledge graphs. In order to introduce the external entity embeddings, they learn to jointly represent the original sen- tences and external knowledge by pre-training on a large scale corpus. However, when switching to textual commonsense, unlike the \u201clight\u201d entity embeddings, the encoding of commonsense descriptions is \u201cheavy\u201d. Therefore, the pre-training for learning to jointly represent the target sentence and external commonsense descriptions is unaffordable. On the other hand, since pre-trained LMs for representing the target sentences alone are readily available, is it feasible to introduce commonsense knowledge in downstream tasks by \ufb01ne-tuning them only? In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play method for large- scale commonsense integration without pre-training. Our method is inspired by the observation that in the regular \ufb01ne-tuning for downstream tasks where no external knowledge was introduced, the variation in the parameters of the language model was minor . Our method starts from a pre-trained LM that represents the target sentences only (e.g., BERT). We think that the pre-training for joint representation learning can be avoided, if the joint represen- tation reduces the impact of parameters on the starting LM. Previous methods such as KnowBERT proposed com- plex modi\ufb01cations to the vanilla LM to introduce external knowledge. Our model (Cook-Transformer, commonsense knowledge- enhanced Transformer), on the other hand, hardly changes the vanilla LM except adding a knowledge to- ken in each Transformer layer. In a variety of experiments, COOK-Transformer-based BERT/RoBERTa improve their effect without any pre-training.",

        "abstract": "A combination of techniques that harness knowledge graphs to improve performance on the NLI problem in the science questions domain and achieves the new state-of-the-art performance over the SciTail science questions dataset. Natural Language Inference (NLI) is fundamental to many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications including semantic search and question answering. The NLI problem has gained significant attention due to the release of large scale, challenging datasets. Present approaches to the problem largely focus on learning-based methods that use only textual information in order to classify whether a given premise entails, contradicts, or is neutral with respect to a given hypothesis. Surprisingly, the use of methods based on structured knowledge \u2013 a central topic in artificial intelligence \u2013 has not received much attention vis-a-vis the NLI problem. While there are many open knowledge bases that contain various types of reasoning information, their use for NLI has not been well explored. To address this, we present a combination of techniques that harness external knowledge to improve performance on the NLI problem in the science questions domain. We present the results of applying our techniques on text, graph, and text-and-graph based models; and discuss the implications of using external knowledge to solve the NLI problem. Our model achieves close to state-of-the-art performance for NLI on the SciTail science questions dataset.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers a purely Visual-based Named Entity Linking (VNEL) task, where the input only consists of an image, and presents a high-quality human-annotated visual person linking dataset, named WIKIPerson. Visual Entity Linking (VEL) is a task to link regions of images with their corresponding entities in Knowledge Bases (KBs), which is beneficial for many computer vision tasks such as image retrieval, image caption, and visual question answering. While existing tasks in VEL either rely on textual data to complement a multi-modal linking or only link objects with general entities, which fails to perform named entity linking on large amounts of image data. In this paper, we consider a purely Visual-based Named Entity Linking (VNEL) task, where the input only consists of an image. The task is to identify objects of interest (i.e., visual entity mentions) in images and link them to corresponding named entities in KBs. Since each entity often contains rich visual and textual information in KBs, we thus propose three different sub-tasks, i.e., visual to visual entity linking (V2VEL), visual to textual entity linking (V2TEL), and visual to visual-textual entity linking (V2VTEL). In addition, we present a high-quality human-annotated visual person linking dataset, named WIKIPerson. Based on WIKIPerson, we establish a series of baseline algorithms for the solution of each sub-task, and conduct experiments to verify the quality of proposed datasets and the effectiveness of baseline methods. We envision this work to be helpful for soliciting more works regarding VNEL in the future. The codes and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/ict-bigdatalab/VNEL.",

        "abstract": "New insights are provided into the practical application of hiPSC-CMs in early or late-stage non-clinical testing during drug development and how they might represent a standard testing tool for evaluating proarrhythmic and contractile potentials. Growing evidence suggests that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) can be used as a new human cell-based platform to assess cardiac toxicity/safety during drug development. Cardiotoxicity assessment is highly challenging due to species differences and various toxicities, such as electrophysiological and contractile toxicities, which can result in proarrhythmia and heart failure. To explore proarrhythmia risk, the multi-electrode array (MEA) platform is widely used to assess QT-interval prolongation and the proarrhythmic potential of drug candidates using hiPSC-CMs. Several consortiums, including the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) and the Japanese iPS Cardiac Safety Assessment (JiCSA) have demonstrated the applicability of hiPSC-CMs/MEA for assessing the torsadogenic potential of drug candidates. Additionally, contractility is a key safety issue in drug development, and efforts have been undertaken to measure contractility by a variety of imaging-based methods using iPS-CMs. Therefore, hiPSC-CMs might represent a standard testing tool for evaluating proarrhythmic and contractile potentials. This review provides new insights into the practical application of hiPSC-CMs in early or late-stage non-clinical testing during drug development.",

        "abstract": "In this review paper, a broad overview of recent literature on bringing explicit anatomical constraints for medical image segmentation is given, the shortcomings and opportunities are discussed and the potential shift towards implicit shape modelling is elaborated. Since the advent of U-Net, fully convolutional deep neural networks and its many variants have completely changed the modern landscape of deep-learning based medical image segmentation. However, the over-dependence of these methods on pixel-level classification and regression has been identified early on as a problem. Especially when trained on medical databases with sparse available annotation, these methods are prone to generate segmentation artifacts such as fragmented structures, topological inconsistencies and islands of pixel. These artifacts are especially problematic in medical imaging since segmentation is almost always a pre-processing step for some downstream evaluations like surgical planning, visualization, prognosis, or treatment planning. However, one common thread across all these downstream tasks is the demand of anatomical consistency. To ensure the segmentation result is anatomically consistent, approaches based on Markov/ Conditional Random Fields, Statistical Shape Models, Active Contours are becoming increasingly popular over the past 5 years. In this review paper, a broad overview of recent literature on bringing explicit anatomical constraints for medical image segmentation is given, the shortcomings and opportunities are discussed and the potential shift towards implicit shape modelling is elaborated. We review the most relevant papers published until the submission date and provide a tabulated view with method details for quick access.",

        "abstract": "This work designs a new framework which can jointly leverage both web data and auxiliary labeled categories to predict the test categories that are not associated with any well-labeled training images. Fine-grained image classification, which targets at distinguishing subtle distinctions among various subordinate categories, remains a very difficult task due to the high annotation cost of enormous fine-grained categories. To cope with the scarcity of well-labeled training images, existing works mainly follow two research directions: 1) utilize freely available web images without human annotation; 2) only annotate some fine-grained categories and transfer the knowledge to other fine-grained categories, which falls into the scope of zero-shot learning (ZSL). However, the above two directions have their own drawbacks. For the first direction, the labels of web images are very noisy and the data distribution between web images and test images are considerably different. For the second direction, the performance gap between ZSL and traditional supervised learning is still very large. The drawbacks of the above two directions motivate us to design a new framework which can jointly leverage both web data and auxiliary labeled categories to predict the test categories that are not associated with any well-labeled training images. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",

The emerging research field of so-called computational psychiatry attempts to contribute to an understanding of complex psychiatric phenomena by applying computational methods and to promote the translation of neuroscientific research results into clinical practice. This article presents this field of research using selected examples based on the distinction between data-driven and theory-driven approaches. Exemplary for a\u00a0data-driven approach are studies to predict clinical outcome, for example, in persons with a high-risk state for psychosis or on the response to pharmacological treatment for depression. Theory-driven approaches attempt to describe the mechanisms of altered information processing as the cause of psychiatric symptoms at the behavioral and neuronal level. In computational models possible mechanisms can be described that may have produced the measured behavioral or neuronal data. For example, in schizophrenia patients the clinical phenomenon of aberrant salience has been described as learning irrelevant information or cognitive deficits have been linked to connectivity changes in frontoparietal networks. Computational psychiatry can make important contributions to the prediction of individual clinical courses as well as to a\u00a0mechanistic understanding of psychiatric symptoms. For this a\u00a0further development of reliable and valid methods across different disciplines is indispensable.",

        "abstract": "This work re-implements the existing NLP methods, which used CNN-LSTM architectures and targeted features from conversational transcripts, and proposes a bi-modal approach for AD classification and discusses the merits and opportunities of this approach. Current methods for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Dementia include structured questionnaires, structured interviews, and various cognitive tests. Language difficulties are a major problem in dementia as linguistic skills break down. Current methods do not provide robust tools to capture the true nature of language deficits in spontaneous speech. Early detection of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) from spontaneous speech overcomes the limitations of earlier approaches as it is less time consuming, can be done at home, and is relatively inexpensive. In this work, we re-implement the existing NLP methods, which used CNN-LSTM architectures and targeted features from conversational transcripts. Our work sheds light on why the accuracy of these models drops to 72.92% on the ADReSS dataset, whereas, they gave state of the art results on the DementiaBank dataset. Further, we build upon these language input-based recurrent neural networks by devising an end-to-end deep learning-based solution that performs a binary classification of Alzheimer's Dementia from the spontaneous speech of the patients. We utilize the ADReSS dataset for all our implementations and explore the deep learning-based methods of combining acoustic features into a common vector using recurrent units. Our approach of combining acoustic features using the Speech-GRU improves the accuracy by 2% in comparison to acoustic baselines. When further enriched by targeted features, the Speech-GRU performs better than acoustic baselines by 6.25%. We propose a bi-modal approach for AD classification and discuss the merits and opportunities of our approach.",

        "abstract": "It is confirmed that for the most popular training dataset, MLSUM, over 50% of the training set is unsuitable for abstractive summarization purposes, and a comprehensive assessment of available models on the cleaned datasets is provided. With recent advancements in the area of Natural Language Processing, the focus is slowly shifting from a purely English-centric view towards more language-specific solutions, including German. Especially practical for businesses to analyze their growing amount of textual data are text summarization systems, which transform long input documents into compressed and more digestible summary texts. In this work, we assess the particular landscape of German abstractive text summarization and investigate the reasons why practically useful solutions for abstractive text summarization are still absent in industry. Our focus is two-fold, analyzing a) training resources, and b) publicly available summarization systems. We are able to show that popular existing datasets exhibit crucial flaws in their assumptions about the original sources, which frequently leads to detrimental effects on system generalization and evaluation biases. We confirm that for the most popular training dataset, MLSUM, over 50% of the training set is unsuitable for abstractive summarization purposes. Furthermore, available systems frequently fail to compare to simple baselines, and ignore more effective and efficient extractive summarization approaches. We attribute poor evaluation quality to a variety of different factors, which are investigated in more detail in this work: A lack of qualitative (and diverse) gold data considered for training, understudied (and untreated) positional biases in some of the existing datasets, and the lack of easily accessible and streamlined pre-processing strategies or analysis tools. We provide a comprehensive assessment of available models on the cleaned datasets, and find that this can lead to a reduction of more than 20 ROUGE-1 points during evaluation.

Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is an old-age disease that comes in different stages and directly affects the different regions of the brain. The research into the detection of AD and its stages has new advancements in terms of single-modality and multimodality approaches. However, sustainable techniques for the detection of AD and its stages still require a greater extent of research. In this study, a multimodal image-fusion method is initially proposed for the fusion of two different modalities, i.e., PET (Positron Emission Tomography) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Further, the features obtained from fused and non-fused biomarkers are passed to the ensemble classifier with a Random Forest-based feature selection strategy. Three classes of Alzheimer\u2019s disease are used in this work, namely AD, MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) and CN (Cognitive Normal). In the resulting analysis, the Binary classifications, i.e., AD vs. CN and MCI vs. CN, attained an accuracy (Acc) of 99% in both cases. The class AD vs. MCI detection achieved an adequate accuracy (Acc) of 91%. Furthermore, the Multi Class classification, i.e., AD vs. MCI vs. CN, achieved 96% (Acc).",

        "abstract": "Stuttering is a speech impediment that is a very complex disorder. It is difficult to diagnose and treat, and is of unknown initiation, despite the large number of studies in this field. Stuttering can take many forms and varies from person to person, and it can change under the influence of external factors. Diagnosing and treating speech disorders such as stuttering requires from a speech therapist, not only good profes-sional preparation, but also experience gained through research and practice in the field. The use of acoustic methods in combination with elements of artificial intelligence makes it possible to objectively assess the disorder, as well as to control the effects of treatment. The main aim of the study was to present an algorithm for automatic recognition of fillers disfluency in the statements of people who stutter. This is done on the basis of their parameterized features in the amplitude-frequency space. The work provides as well, exemplary results demonstrating their possibility and effectiveness. In order to verify and optimize the procedures, the statements of seven stutterers with duration of 2 to 4 minutes were selected. Over 70% efficiency and predictability of automatic detection of these disfluencies was achieved. The use of an automatic method in conjunction with therapy for a stuttering person can give us the opportunity to objectively assess the disorder, as well as to evaluate the progress of therapy.",

        "abstract": "The feasibility of using the AI-powered end-to-end model for early AD diagnosis and severity prediction directly based on voice is demonstrated, showing its potential for screening Alzheimer\u2019s disease in a community setting. There is currently no simple, widely available screening method for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), partly because the diagnosis of AD is complex and typically involves expensive and sometimes invasive tests not commonly available outside highly specialized clinical settings. Here, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered end-to-end system to detect AD and predict its severity directly from voice recordings. At the core of our system is the pre-trained data2vec model, the first high-performance self-supervised algorithm that works for speech, vision, and text. Our model was internally evaluated on the ADReSSo (Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech only) dataset containing voice recordings of subjects describing the Cookie Theft picture, and externally validated on a test dataset from DementiaBank. The AI model can detect AD with average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.846 and 0.835 on held-out and external test set, respectively. The model was well-calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit p-value = 0.9616). Moreover, the model can reliably predict the subject\u2019s cognitive testing score solely based on raw voice recordings. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using the AI-powered end-to-end model for early AD diagnosis and severity prediction directly based on voice, showing its potential for screening Alzheimer\u2019s disease in a community setting.",

Automatic monitoring of the patients with Alzheimer's disease and diagnosis of the disease in early stages can have a significant impact on the society. Here, we investigate an automatic diagnosis approach through the use of features derived from transcriptions of conversations with the subjects. As opposed to standard tests that are mostly focused on memory recall, spontaneous conversations are carried with the subjects in informal settings. Features extracted from the transcriptions of the conversations could discriminate between healthy people and patients with high reliability. Although the results are preliminary and patients were in later stages of Alzheimer's disease, results indicate the potential use of the proposed natural language based features in the early stages of the disease also. Moreover, the data collection process employed here can be done inexpensively by call center agents in a real-life application using automatic speech recognition systems (ASR) which are known to have very high accuracies in recent years. Thus, the investigated features hold the potential to make it low-cost and convenient to diagnose the disease and monitor the diagnosed patients over time.",

        "abstract": "The proposed Latent Space Representation Network (LSRNet) is constructed and uses two stages to train the network and has a good classification performance and provides a new approach to the diagnosis of other brain diseases. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been used to construct functional connectivity (FC) in the brain for the diagnosis and analysis of brain disease. Current studies typically use the Pearson correlation coefficient to construct dynamic FC (dFC) networks, and then use this as a network metric to obtain the necessary features for brain disease diagnosis and analysis. This simple observational approach makes it difficult to extract potential high-level FC features from the representations, and also ignores the rich information on spatial and temporal variability in FC. In this paper, we construct the Latent Space Representation Network (LSRNet) and use two stages to train the network. In the first stage, an autoencoder is used to extract potential high-level features and inner connections in the dFC representations. In the second stage, high-level features are extracted using two perspective feature parses. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are used to extract spatial and temporal features from the local perspective. Convolutional neural networks extract global high-level features from the global perspective. Finally, the fusion of spatial and temporal features with global high-level features is used to diagnose brain disease. In this paper, the proposed method is applied to the ANDI rs-fMRI dataset, and the classification accuracy reaches 84.6% for NC/eMCI, 95.1% for NC/AD, 80.6% for eMCI/lMCI, 84.2% for lMCI/AD and 57.3% for NC/eMCI/lMCI/AD. The experimental results show that the method has a good classification performance and provides a new approach to the diagnosis of other brain diseases.",

        "abstract": "The suggested model outperforms the traditional methods for classifying Alzheimer\u2019s disease stages from brain MRI, as measured by a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test, with a significance of <0.05. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is largely the underlying cause of dementia due to its progressive neurodegenerative nature among the elderly. The disease can be divided into five stages: Subjective Memory Concern (SMC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Early MCI (EMCI), Late MCI (LMCI), and Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD). Alzheimer\u2019s disease is conventionally diagnosed using an MRI scan of the brain. In this research, we propose a fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier called AlzheimerNet, which can identify all five stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and the Normal Control (NC) class. The ADNI database\u2019s MRI scan dataset is obtained for use in training and testing the proposed model. To prepare the raw data for analysis, we applied the CLAHE image enhancement method. Data augmentation was used to remedy the unbalanced nature of the dataset and the resultant dataset consisted of 60000 image data on the 6 classes. Initially, five existing models including VGG16, MobileNetV2, AlexNet, ResNet50 and InceptionV3 were trained and tested to achieve test accuracies of 78.84%, 86.85%, 78.87%, 80.98% and 96.31% respectively. Since InceptionV3 provides the highest accuracy, this model is later modified to design the AlzheimerNet using RMSprop optimizer and learning rate 0.00001 to achieve the highest test accuracy of 98.67%. The five pre-trained models and the proposed fine-tuned model were compared in terms of various performance matrices to demonstrate whether the AlzheimerNet model is in fact performing better in classifying and detecting the six classes. An ablation study shows the hyperparameters used in the experiment. The suggested model outperforms the traditional methods for classifying Alzheimer\u2019s disease stages from brain MRI, as measured by a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test, with a significance of <0.05.",

        "abstract": "The existing findings on the use of artificial intelligence, speech, and language processing to predict cognitive decline in the context of Alzheimer\u2019s disease are summarized. Background: Language is a valuable source of clinical information in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, as it declines concurrently with neurodegeneration. Consequently, speech and language data have been extensively studied in connection with its diagnosis. Objective: Firstly, to summarize the existing findings on the use of artificial intelligence, speech, and language processing to predict cognitive decline in the context of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Secondly, to detail current research procedures, highlight their limitations, and suggest strategies to address them. Methods: Systematic review of original research between 2000 and 2019, registered in PROSPERO (reference CRD42018116606). An interdisciplinary search covered six databases on engineering (ACM and IEEE), psychology (PsycINFO), medicine (PubMed and Embase), and Web of Science. Bibliographies of relevant papers were screened until December 2019. Results: From 3,654 search results, 51 articles were selected against the eligibility criteria. Four tables summarize their findings: study details (aim, population, interventions, comparisons, methods, and outcomes), data details (size, type, modalities, annotation, balance, availability, and language of study), methodology (pre-processing, feature generation, machine learning, evaluation, and results), and clinical applicability (research implications, clinical potential, risk of bias, and strengths/limitations). Conclusion: Promising results are reported across nearly all 51 studies, but very few have been implemented in clinical research or practice. The main limitations of the field are poor standardization, limited comparability of results, and a degree of disconnect between study aims and clinical applications. Active attempts to close these gaps will support translation of future research into clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Experimental results show that the proposed pretraining methods outperform or are on par with the state-of-the-art sequence-based methods, while using much less pretraining data. Learning effective protein representations is critical in a variety of tasks in biology such as predicting protein function or structure. Existing approaches usually pretrain protein language models on a large number of unlabeled amino acid sequences and then finetune the models with some labeled data in downstream tasks. Despite the effectiveness of sequence-based approaches, the power of pretraining on known protein structures, which are available in smaller numbers only, has not been explored for protein property prediction, though protein structures are known to be determinants of protein function. In this paper, we propose to pretrain protein representations according to their 3D structures. We first present a simple yet effective encoder to learn the geometric features of a protein. We pretrain the protein graph encoder by leveraging multiview contrastive learning and different self-prediction tasks. Experimental results on both function prediction and fold classification tasks show that our proposed pretraining methods outperform or are on par with the state-of-the-art sequence-based methods, while using much less pretraining data. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/GearNet.",

Incorporating factual knowledge into pre-trained language models (PLM) such as BERT is an emerging trend in recent NLP studies. However, most of the existing methods combine the external knowledge integration module with a modified pre-training loss and re-implement the pre-training process on the large-scale corpus. Re-pretraining these models is usually resource-consuming, and difficult to adapt to another domain with a different knowledge graph (KG). Besides, those works either cannot embed knowledge context dynamically according to textual context or struggle with the knowledge ambiguity issue. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-aware language model framework based on fine-tuning process, which equips PLM with a unified knowledge-enhanced text graph that contains both text and multi-relational sub-graphs extracted from KG. We design a hierarchical relational-graph-based message passing mechanism, which can allow the representations of injected KG and text to mutually update each other and can dynamically select ambiguous mentioned entities that share the same text. Our empirical results show that our model can efficiently incorporate world knowledge from KGs into existing language models such as BERT, and achieve significant improvement on the machine reading comprehension (MRC) task compared with other knowledge-enhanced models.",

        "abstract": "This paper takes a modified BERT network with siamese and triplet network structures and replaces BERT with ALBERT to create Sentence-ALberT (SALBERT), and evaluates performances of all sentence-embedding models considered using the STS and NLI datasets. Contextualized representations from a pre-trained language model are central to achieve a high performance on downstream NLP task. The pre-trained BERT and A Lite BERT (ALBERT) models can be fine-tuned to give state-of-the-art results in sentence-pair regressions such as semantic textual similarity (STS) and natural language inference (NLI). Although BERT-based models yield the [CLS] token vector as a reasonable sentence embedding, the search for an optimal sentence embedding scheme remains an active research area in computational linguistics. This paper explores on sentence embedding models for BERT and ALBERT. In particular, we take a modified BERT network with siamese and triplet network structures called Sentence-BERT (SBERT) and replace BERT with ALBERT to create Sentence-ALBERT (SALBERT). We also experiment with an outer CNN sentence-embedding network for SBERT and SALBERT. We evaluate performances of all sentence-embedding models considered using the STS and NLI datasets. The empirical results indicate that our CNN architecture improves ALBERT models substantially more than BERT models for STS benchmark. Despite significantly fewer model parameters, ALBERT sentence embedding is highly competitive to BERT in downstream NLP evaluations.",

In this paper we present a web-based open source tool and a method for generating insight from any text or discourse using text network analysis. The tool (InfraNodus) can be used by researchers and writers to organize and to better understand their notes, to measure the level of bias in discourse, and to identify the parts of the discourse where there is a potential for insight and new ideas. The method is based on text network analysis algorithm, which represents any text as a network and identifies the most influential words in a discourse based on the terms' co-occurrence. Graph community detection algorithm is then applied in order to identify the different topical clusters, which represent the main topics in the text as well as the relations between them. The community structure is used in conjunction with other measures to identify the level of bias or cognitive diversity of the discourse. Finally, the structural gaps in the graph can indicate the parts of the discourse where the connections are lacking, therefore highlighting the areas where there's a potential for new ideas. The tool can be used as stand-alone software by end users as well as implemented via an API into other tools. Another interesting application is in the field of recommendation systems: structural gaps could indicate potentially interesting non-trivial connections to any connected datasets.",

        "abstract": "Commonsense knowledge transfer is introduced, a framework to transfer the commonsense knowledge stored in a neural Commonsense knowledge model to a general-purpose pre-trained language model that refines the language model with two self-supervised objectives: commonsense mask infilling and commonsense relation prediction, which align human language with the underlying commonsenseknowledge. Despite serving as the foundation models for a wide range of NLP benchmarks, pre-trained language models have shown limited capabilities of acquiring implicit commonsense knowledge from self-supervision alone, compared to learning linguistic and factual knowledge that appear more explicitly in the surface patterns in text. In this work, we introduce commonsense knowledge transfer, a framework to transfer the commonsense knowledge stored in a neural commonsense knowledge model to a general-purpose pre-trained language model. It first exploits general texts to form queries for extracting commonsense knowledge from the neural commonsense knowledge model and then refines the language model with two self-supervised objectives: commonsense mask infilling and commonsense relation prediction, which align human language with the underlying commonsense knowledge. Empirical results show that our approach consistently improves the model's performance on downstream tasks that require commonsense reasoning. Moreover, we find that the improvement is more significant in the few-shot setting. This suggests that our approach helps language models better transfer to downstream tasks without extensive supervision by injecting commonsense knowledge into their parameters.",

Natural language inference (NLI) is the basic task of many applications such as question answering and paraphrase recognition. Existing methods have solved the key issue of how the NLI model can benefit from external knowledge. Inspired by this, we attempt to further explore the following two problems: (1) how to make better use of external knowledge when the total amount of such knowledge is constant and (2) how to bring external knowledge to the NLI model more conveniently in the application scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel joint training framework that consists of a modified graph attention network, called the knowledge graph attention network, and an NLI model. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing method which introduces external knowledge, and we improve the performance of multiple NLI models without additional external knowledge.",

Since iPSC-cardiomyocyte (CM) was first generated, their characterization has become a major focus of research. Multi-/micro-electrode array (MEA) systems provide a non-invasive user-friendly platform for detailed electrophysiological analysis of iPSC cardiomyocytes including drug testing to identify potential targets and the assessment of proarrhythmic risk. Here, we provide a systematical overview about the physiological and technical background of micro-electrode array measurements of iPSC-CM. We introduce the similarities and differences between action- and field potential and the advantages and drawbacks of MEA technology. In addition, we present current studies focusing on proarrhythmic side effects of novel and established compounds combining MEA systems and iPSC-CM. MEA technology will help to open a new gateway for novel therapies in cardiovascular diseases while reducing animal experiments at the same time.",

        "abstract": "The quantitative evaluation of the segmentation results indicated that the proposed PCA-based loss function would lead to significant improvements in organ/structure segmentations from medical images, including improvements in hippocampus and heart segmentation from MR and CT images. Automated medical image segmentation is an essential task to aid/speed up diagnosis and treatment procedures in clinical practices. Deep convolutional neural networks have exhibited promising performance in accurate and automatic seminal segmentation. For segmentation tasks, these methods normally rely on minimizing a cost/loss function that is designed to maximize the overlap between the estimated target and the ground-truth mask delineated by the experts. A simple loss function based on the degrees of overlap (i.e., Dice metric) would not take into account the underlying shape and morphology of the target subject, as well as its realistic/natural variations; therefore, suboptimal segmentation results would be observed in the form of islands of voxels, holes, and unrealistic shapes or deformations. In this light, many studies have been conducted to refine/post-process the segmentation outcome and consider an initial guess as prior knowledge to avoid outliers and/or unrealistic estimations. In this study, a novel shape-based cost function is proposed which encourages/constrains the network to learn/capture the underlying shape features in order to generate a valid/realistic estimation of the target structure. To this end, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on a vectorized training dataset to extract eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the target subjects. The key idea was to use the reconstruction weights to discriminate valid outcomes from outliers/erroneous estimations. To evaluate the proposed segmentation framework, a 3D fully convolutional neural network was trained with a conventional loss function (Binary Cross-Entropy) and the proposed loss function. These models were evaluated using two separate datasets for hippocampus and heart segmentation tasks. When the proposed shape-based loss function was employed instead of the Binary CrossEntropy, the Dice scores improved from 0.81\u00b10.03 and 0.74\u00b10.07 to 0.86\u00b10.03 and 0.87\u00b10.05 for hippocampus and heart segmentation from MR and CT images, respectively. Moreover, no outliers, patchy, and unrealistic estimations were observed when the proposed PCA-based loss function was exploited. The quantitative evaluation of the segmentation results indicated that the proposed PCA-based loss function would lead to significant improvements in organ/structure segmentations from medical images.

        "abstract": "This work develops a novel approach which can jointly exploit both noisy web training data from test categories and well-labeled trainingData from auxiliary categories by using the surrounding textual information of web data as privileged information of all categories. Fine-grained classification remains a very challenging problem, because of the absence of well-labeled training data caused by the high cost of annotating a large number of fine-grained categories. In the extreme case, given a set of test categories without any well-labeled training data, the majority of existing works can be grouped into the following two research directions: 1) crawl noisy labeled web data for the test categories as training data, which is dubbed as webly supervised learning; 2) transfer the knowledge from auxiliary categories with well-labeled training data to the test categories, which corresponds to zero-shot learning setting. Nevertheless, the above two research directions still have critical issues to be addressed. For the first direction, web data have noisy labels and considerably different data distribution from test data. For the second direction, zero-shot learning is struggling to achieve compelling results compared with conventional supervised learning. The issues of the above two directions motivate us to develop a novel approach which can jointly exploit both noisy web training data from test categories and well-labeled training data from auxiliary categories. In particular, on one hand, we crawl web data for test categories as noisy training data. On the other hand, we transfer the knowledge from auxiliary categories with well-labeled training data to test categories by virtue of free semantic information (e.g., word vector) of all categories. Moreover, given the fact that web data are generally associated with additional textual information (e.g., title and tag), we extend our method by using the surrounding textual information of web data as privileged information. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed methods.",

        "abstract": "An overview of basic categories and fields of application of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis, prevention and therapy of mental disorders and Psychiatrists should seize the opportunity to actively shape the implementation of AI-systems. Objective The aim of the article is to enable a fundamental understanding of the potentials and requirements of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for psychiatrists in the present and for the development of future working environments. Psychiatrists will need to understand the function of AI-systems and personalized AI-assistants in therapy systems and as part of their patients\u2019 daily life. Method The article provides an overview of basic categories and fields of application of AI and machine learning in the diagnosis, prevention and therapy of mental disorders. Results AI-applications will shape the prevention, diagnosis and treatment as well as the basic etiological understanding of mental disorders. Notably, the treatment of mental disorders is significantly influenced by commercial product development and assistance systems outside the medical system, as the corresponding developments can exploit large data pools with significantly lower restrictions. Conclusion Psychiatrists should now seize the opportunity to actively shape the implementation of AI-systems as otherwise key competences could be transferred to a primary field outside the medical system to the detriment of the patient and the therapist.

        "abstract": "New methods to detect AD patients and predict the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in an end-to-end trainable manner consisting of a combination of BERT, Vision Transformer, Co-Attention, Multimodal Shifting Gate, and a variant of the self-attention mechanism are presented. Alzheimer's dementia (AD) entails negative psychological, social, and economic consequences not only for the patients but also for their families, relatives, and society in general. Despite the significance of this phenomenon and the importance for an early diagnosis, there are still limitations. Specifically, the main limitation is pertinent to the way the modalities of speech and transcripts are combined in a single neural network. Existing research works add/concatenate the image and text representations, employ majority voting approaches or average the predictions after training many textual and speech models separately. To address these limitations, in this article we present some new methods to detect AD patients and predict the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in an end-to-end trainable manner consisting of a combination of BERT, Vision Transformer, Co-Attention, Multimodal Shifting Gate, and a variant of the self-attention mechanism. Specifically, we convert audio to Log-Mel spectrograms, their delta, and delta-delta (acceleration values). First, we pass each transcript and image through a BERT model and Vision Transformer, respectively, adding a co-attention layer at the top, which generates image and word attention simultaneously. Secondly, we propose an architecture, which integrates multimodal information to a BERT model via a Multimodal Shifting Gate. Finally, we introduce an approach to capture both the inter- and intra-modal interactions by concatenating the textual and visual representations and utilizing a self-attention mechanism, which includes a gate model. Experiments conducted on the ADReSS Challenge dataset indicate that our introduced models demonstrate valuable advantages over existing research initiatives achieving competitive results in both the AD classification and MMSE regression task. Specifically, our best performing model attains an accuracy of 90.00% and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 3.61 in the AD classification task and MMSE regression task, respectively, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance in the MMSE regression task.",

Automatic text summarization has made tremendous progress in recent years. However, the rating of a summary is still an open research topic. Especially when it comes to measuring the abstractiveness, existing evaluation metrics like ROUGE, BLEU or METEOR show severe shortcomings. In the 2nd German Text Summarization Challenge we aimed to explore new ideas and solutions regarding an automatic quality assessment of German text summarizations. For the challenge, we provided a text corpus together with several summaries per text. The goal was to assign a quality measure in the range from 0 (bad) to 1 (excellent) to each summary. We asked the participants to consider aspects such as correctness in content and grammar as well as facets like compactness and abstractiveness. The participants were able to submit (and resubmit) their solution to our evaluation board. The solution was evaluated automatically, and the achieved rank published on the leaderboard.",

        "title": "Early Detection of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Novel Approach Combining Convolutional Neural Networks and Ensemble Learning",
        "abstract": "The results suggest that as a data-driven method, the combined CNN and EL approach can locate the most discriminable brain regions indicated by the trained ensemble model while the generalization ability of the ensemble model was maximized to successfully capture AD-related brain variations early in the disease process. Early detection is critical for effective management of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is common practice. Among several deep-learning techniques that have been applied to assessing structural brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained popularity due to its superb efficiency in automated feature learning with the use of a variety of multilayer perceptrons. Meanwhile, ensemble learning (EL) has shown to be beneficial in the robustness of learning-system performance via integrating multiple models. Here, we proposed a classifier ensemble developed by combining CNN and EL, i.e., the CNN-EL approach, to identify subjects with MCI or AD using MRI: i.e., classification between (1) AD and healthy cognition (HC), (2) MCIc (MCI patients who will convert to AD) and HC, and (3) MCIc and MCInc (MCI patients who will not convert to AD). For each binary classification task, a large number of CNN models were trained applying a set of sagittal, coronal, or transverse MRI slices; these CNN models were then integrated into a single ensemble. Performance of the ensemble was evaluated using stratified fivefold cross-validation method for 10 times. The number of the intersection points determined by the most discriminable slices separating two classes in a binary classification task among the sagittal, coronal, and transverse slice sets, transformed into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, acted as an indicator to assess the ability of a brain region in which the points were located to classify AD. Thus, the brain regions with most intersection points were considered as those mostly contributing to the early diagnosis of AD. The result revealed an accuracy rate of 0.84 \u00b1 0.05, 0.79 \u00b1 0.04, and 0.62 \u00b1 0.06, respectively, for classifying AD vs. HC, MCIc vs. HC, and MCIc vs. MCInc, comparable to previous reports and a 3D deep learning approach (3D-SENet) based on a more state-of-the-art and popular Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks model using channel attention mechanism. Notably, the intersection points accurately located the medial temporal lobe and several other structures of the limbic system, i.e., brain regions known to be struck early in AD. More interestingly, the classifiers disclosed multiple patterned MRI changes in the brain in AD and MCIc, involving these key regions. These results suggest that as a data-driven method, the combined CNN and EL approach can locate the most discriminable brain regions indicated by the trained ensemble model while the generalization ability of the ensemble model was maximized to successfully capture AD-related brain variations early in the disease process; it can also provide new insights into understanding the complex heterogeneity of whole-brain MRI changes in AD. Further research is needed to examine the clinical implication of the finding, capability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to help understand and evaluate an individual subject\u2019s disease status, symptom burden and progress, and the generalizability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to locate the most discriminable brain regions in the detection of other brain disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and severe depression, in a data-driven way.",

        "abstract": "The presented work constitutes a continuation of research on automatic disfluency recognition in utterances by stuttering people. One of the most frequently occurring episodes are syllable repetitions. The repeated fragments have a similar spectral structure, but they differ in their duration times. In order to detect them, correlation of 1/3 octave spectra was applied in connection with the procedures analysing the amplitude-time structure of sound files. The elaborated computer programme allows for recognition of that type of difluency in continuous speech and for exact, graphically illustrated location of the detected episodes in a sound file. It has been verified on the basis of over a hundred 4-second non-fluent utterances. Its functioning has been examined at various border values of the correlation co-efficient and various widths of the time window. Over 70% efficiency of the automatic detection of the episodes has been achieved. The result is comparable to those achieved with the use of the audio monitoring method.",

Research related to automatically detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important, given the high prevalence of AD and the high cost of traditional methods. Since AD significantly affects the content and acoustics of spontaneous speech, natural language processing and machine learning provide promising techniques for reliably detecting AD. We compare and contrast the performance of two such approaches for AD detection on the recent ADReSS challenge dataset: 1) using domain knowledge-based hand-crafted features that capture linguistic and acoustic phenomena, and 2) fine-tuning Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT)-based sequence classification models. We also compare multiple feature-based regression models for a neuropsychological score task in the challenge. We observe that fine-tuned BERT models, given the relative importance of linguistics in cognitive impairment detection, outperform feature-based approaches on the AD detection task.",

        "abstract": "An automatic and accurate diagnostic model by using the linguistic characteristics of the subjects and hybrid word embedding, which could be used as a large-scale screening method for AD, as well as a complement to doctors\u2019 detection of AD. Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is of great importance to the benefits of AD patients, including lessening symptoms and alleviating the financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, changes of language capability can potentially be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I develop an automatic and accurate diagnostic model by using the linguistic characteristics of the subjects and hybrid word embedding. I detected linguistic features such as pauses, unintelligible words, repetitions, etc. from transcripts of interviews. Then I create a text embedding by combining word vectors from Doc2vec and ELMo. Moreover, by tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g., model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2vec, and vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 97% for distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Compared with the method which only uses word count, I improved the absolute detection accuracy by 10%, and the absolute AUC by 9%. Moreover, I study the stability of the model by repeating experiment and find out that the model is stable even though my training data is split randomly. My algorithms have high detection accuracy and are stable. This model could be used as a large-scale screening method for AD, as well as a complement to doctors\u2019 detection of AD.",

        "abstract": "A unique Spatial-Temporal convolutional-recurrent neural Network (STNet) for automated prediction of AD progression and network hub detection from rs-fMRI time series is proposed, which incorporates the spatial-temporal information mining and AD-related hub detection into an end-to-end deep learning model. Early identification of dementia at the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is crucial for timely diagnosis and intervention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although several pioneering studies have been devoted to automated AD diagnosis based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), their performance is somewhat limited due to non-effective mining of spatial-temporal dependency. Besides, few of these existing approaches consider the explicit detection and modeling of discriminative brain regions (i.e., network hubs) that are sensitive to AD progression. In this paper, we propose a unique Spatial-Temporal convolutional-recurrent neural Network (STNet) for automated prediction of AD progression and network hub detection from rs-fMRI time series. Our STNet incorporates the spatial-temporal information mining and AD-related hub detection into an end-to-end deep learning model. Specifically, we first partition rs-fMRI time series into a sequence of overlapping sliding windows. A sequence of convolutional components are then designed to capture the local-to-global spatially-dependent patterns within each sliding window, based on which we are able to identify discriminative hubs and characterize their unique contributions to disease diagnosis. A recurrent component with long short-term memory (LSTM) units is further employed to model the whole-brain temporal dependency from the spatially-dependent pattern sequences, thus capturing the temporal dynamics along time. We evaluate the proposed method on 174 subjects with 563 rs-fMRI scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, with results suggesting the effectiveness of our method in both tasks of disease progression prediction and AD-related hub detection.",

Potatoes are a high-protein food with several health benefits, but there are numerous diseases associated with potatoes that hamper production. In this research, we developed a hybrid approach that employs image processing and combines MobileNet V2 with LSTM, GRU, and Bidirectional LSTM to evaluate potato disease classes known as Black Scurf, Common Scab, Blackleg, Dry Rot, Pink Rot, Healthy, and Miscellaneous. We examined the outcomes of each architecture after applying it independently to determine the optimal architecture configuration for categorizing potato diseases. In terms of accuracy, the results show that the hybrid MobileNet V2-GRU with Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer strategy exceeds the other alternative. On the test dataset, we achieved 99% accuracy.",

        "abstract": "This study identifies AD-related language impairment that generalizes beyond a single corpus or language to model language impairment as a clinically-relevant cognitive symptom by leveraging multilingual statistics combined with a theory-driven approach. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a pervasive neurodegenerative disease that affects millions worldwide and is most prominently associated with broad cognitive decline, including language impairment. Picture description tasks are routinely used to monitor language impairment in AD. Due to the high amount of manual resources needed for an in-depth analysis of thereby-produced spontaneous speech, advanced natural language processing (NLP) combined with machine learning (ML) represents a promising opportunity. In this applied research field though, NLP and ML methodology do not necessarily ensure robust clinically actionable insights into cognitive language impairment in AD and additional precautions must be taken to ensure clinical-validity and generalizability of results. In this study, we add generalizability through multilingual feature statistics to computational approaches for the detection of language impairment in AD. We include 154 participants (78 healthy subjects, 76 patients with AD) from two different languages (106 English speaking and 47 French speaking). Each participant completed a picture description task, in addition to a battery of neuropsychological tests. Each response was recorded and manually transcribed. From this, task-specific, semantic, syntactic and paralinguistic features are extracted using NLP resources. Using inferential statistics, we determined language features, excluding task specific features, that are significant in both languages and therefore represent \u201cgeneralizable\u201d signs for cognitive language impairment in AD. In a second step, we evaluated all features as well as the generalizable ones for English, French and both languages in a binary discrimination ML scenario (AD vs. healthy) using a variety of classifiers. The generalizable language feature set outperforms the all language feature set in English, French and the multilingual scenarios. Semantic features are the most generalizable while paralinguistic features show no overlap between languages. The multilingual model shows an equal distribution of error in both English and French. By leveraging multilingual statistics combined with a theory-driven approach, we identify AD-related language impairment that generalizes beyond a single corpus or language to model language impairment as a clinically-relevant cognitive symptom. We find a primary impairment in semantics in addition to mild syntactic impairment, possibly confounded by additional impaired cognitive functions.",

        "abstract": "The DiffPreT approach to pre-train a protein encoder by sequence-structure multimodal diffusion modeling, and a physics-inspired method called Siamese Diffusion Trajectory Prediction (SiamDiff) to capture the correlation between different conformers of a protein. Pre-training methods on proteins are recently gaining interest, leveraging either protein sequences or structures, while modeling their joint energy landscape is largely unexplored. In this work, inspired by the success of denoising diffusion models, we propose the DiffPreT approach to pre-train a protein encoder by sequence-structure multimodal diffusion modeling. DiffPreT guides the encoder to recover the native protein sequences and structures from the perturbed ones along the multimodal diffusion trajectory, which acquires the joint distribution of sequences and structures. Considering the essential protein conformational variations, we enhance DiffPreT by a physics-inspired method called Siamese Diffusion Trajectory Prediction (SiamDiff) to capture the correlation between different conformers of a protein. SiamDiff attains this goal by maximizing the mutual information between representations of diffusion trajectories of structurally-correlated conformers. We study the effectiveness of DiffPreT and SiamDiff on both atom- and residue-level structure-based protein understanding tasks. Experimental results show that the performance of DiffPreT is consistently competitive on all tasks, and SiamDiff achieves new state-of-the-art performance, considering the mean ranks on all tasks. The source code will be released upon acceptance.",

        "abstract": "KALM is proposed, a Knowledge-Aware Language Model that jointly leverages knowledge in local, document-level, and global contexts for long document understanding, and reveals that the three knowledge-aware contexts are complementary and they all contribute to model performance. With the advent of pretrained language models (LMs), increasing research efforts have been focusing on infusing commonsense and domain-specific knowledge to prepare LMs for downstream tasks. These works attempt to leverage knowledge graphs, the de facto standard of symbolic knowledge representation, along with pretrained LMs. While existing approaches have leveraged external knowledge, it remains an open question how to jointly incorporate knowledge graphs representing varying contexts, from local (e.g., sentence), to document-level, to global knowledge, to enable knowledge-rich exchange across these contexts. Such rich contextualization can be especially beneficial for long document understanding tasks since standard pretrained LMs are typically bounded by the input sequence length. In light of these challenges, we propose KALM, a Knowledge-Aware Language Model that jointly leverages knowledge in local, document-level, and global contexts for long document understanding. KALM first encodes long documents and knowledge graphs into the three knowledge-aware context representations. It then processes each context with context-specific layers, followed by a context fusion layer that facilitates knowledge exchange to derive an overarching document representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KALM achieves state-of-the-art performance on six long document understanding tasks and datasets. Further analyses reveal that the three knowledge-aware contexts are complementary and they all contribute to model performance, while the importance and information exchange patterns of different contexts vary with respect to different tasks and datasets.",

Discourse cohesion facilitates text comprehension and helps the reader form a coherent narrative. In this study, we aim to computationally analyze the discourse cohesion in scientific scholarly texts using multilayer network representation and quantify the writing quality of the document. Exploiting the hierarchical structure of scientific scholarly texts, we design section-level and document-level metrics to assess the extent of lexical cohesion in text. We use a publicly available dataset along with a curated set of contrasting examples to validate the proposed metrics by comparing them against select indices computed using existing cohesion analysis tools. We observe that the proposed metrics correlate as expected with the existing cohesion indices. We also present an analytical framework, CHIAA (CHeck It Again, Author), to provide pointers to the author for potential improvements in the manuscript with the help of the section-level and document-level metrics. The proposed CHIAA framework furnishes a clear and precise prescription to the author for improving writing by localizing regions in text with cohesion gaps. We demonstrate the efficacy of CHIAA framework using succinct examples from cohesion-deficient text excerpts in the experimental dataset.",

        "abstract": "This investigation reveals promising results when implicit knowledge from deep pre-trained language models is transferred to generate explicit knowledge in commonsense knowledge graphs, and suggests that using generative commonsense models for automatic commonsense KB completion could soon be a plausible alternative to extractive methods. We present the first comprehensive study on automatic knowledge base construction for two prevalent commonsense knowledge graphs: ATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019) and ConceptNet (Speer et al., 2017). Contrary to many conventional KBs that store knowledge with canonical templates, commonsense KBs only store loosely structured open-text descriptions of knowledge. We posit that an important step toward automatic commonsense completion is the development of generative models of commonsense knowledge, and propose COMmonsEnse Transformers (COMET) that learn to generate rich and diverse commonsense descriptions in natural language. Despite the challenges of commonsense modeling, our investigation reveals promising results when implicit knowledge from deep pre-trained language models is transferred to generate explicit knowledge in commonsense knowledge graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that COMET is able to generate novel knowledge that humans rate as high quality, with up to 77.5% (ATOMIC) and 91.7% (ConceptNet) precision at top 1, which approaches human performance for these resources. Our findings suggest that using generative commonsense models for automatic commonsense KB completion could soon be a plausible alternative to extractive methods.",

In the era of big data, the field of enterprise risk is facing considerable challenges brought by massive multisource heterogeneous information sources. In view of the proliferation of multisource and heterogeneous enterprise risk information, insufficient knowledge fusion capabilities, and the low level of intelligence in risk management, this article explores the application process of enterprise knowledge service models for rapid responses to risk incidents from the perspective of semantic reasoning and data fusion and clarifies the elements of the knowledge service model in the field of risk management. Based on risk data, risk decision making as the standard, risk events as the driving force, and knowledge graph analysis methods as the power, the risk domain knowledge service process is decomposed into three stages: prewarning, in-event response, and postevent summary. These stages are combined with the empirical knowledge of risk event handling to construct a three-level knowledge service model of risk domain knowledge acquisition-organization-application. This model introduces the semantic reasoning and data fusion method to express, organize, and integrate the knowledge needs of different stages of risk events; provide enterprise managers with risk management knowledge service solutions; and provide new growth points for the innovation of interdisciplinary knowledge service theory.",

Recent work in entity disambiguation (ED) has typically neglected structured knowledge base (KB) facts, and instead relied on a limited subset of KB information, such as entity descriptions or types. This limits the range of contexts in which entities can be disambiguated. To allow the use of all KB facts, as well as descriptions and types, we introduce an ED model which links entities by reasoning over a symbolic knowledge base in a fully differentiable fashion. Our model surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on six well-established ED datasets by 1.3 F1 on average. By allowing access to all KB information, our model is less reliant on popularity-based entity priors, and improves performance on the challenging ShadowLink dataset (which emphasises infrequent and ambiguous entities) by 12.7 F1.",

Cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) are widely used in in vitro biomedical research and testing. However, fully matured, adult cardiomyocyte characteristics have not been achieved. To improve the maturity and physiological relevance of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, we co-cultured them with preconstructed vascular-like networks to form a functional, human cell-based cardiac tissue model. The morphology and gene expression profiles indicated advanced maturation in the cardiac tissue model compared to those of a cardiomyocyte monoculture. The cardiac tissue model\u2019s functionality was confirmed by measuring the effects of 32 compounds with multielectrode array and comparing results to human data. Our model predicted the cardiac effects with a predictive accuracy of 91%, sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 100%. The correlation between the effective concentration (EC50) and the reported clinical plasma concentrations was 0.952 (R2\u2009=\u20090.905). The developed advanced human cell-based cardiac tissue model showed characteristics and functionality of human cardiac tissue enabling accurate transferability of gained in vitro data to human settings. The model is standardized and thus, it would be highly useful in biomedical research and cardiotoxicity testing.",

        "abstract": "The qualitative/quantitative analysis demonstrated that the proposed model improved the performance of all four DNN models through producing images of higher quality and lower quantitative bias and variance compared to reference images. A small dataset commonly affects generalization, robustness, and overall performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) in medical imaging research. Since gathering large clinical databases is always difficult, we proposed an analytical method for producing a large realistic/diverse dataset. Clinical brain PET/CT/MR images including full-dose (FD), low-dose (LD) corresponding to only 5 % of events acquired in the FD scan, non-attenuated correction (NAC) and CT-based measured attenuation correction (MAC) PET images, CT images and T1 and T2 MR sequences of 35 patients were included. All images were registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template. Laplacian blending was used to make a natural presentation using information in the frequency domain of images from two separate patients, as well as the blending mask. This classical technique from the computer vision and image processing communities is still widely used and unlike modern DNNs, does not require the availability of training data. A modified ResNet DNN was implemented to evaluate four image-to-image translation tasks, including LD to FD, LD+MR to FD, NAC to MAC, and MRI to CT, with and without using the synthesized images. Quantitative analysis using established metrics, including the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index metric (SSIM), and joint histogram analysis was performed for quantitative evaluation. The quantitative comparison between the registered small dataset containing 35 patients and the large dataset containing 350 synthesized plus 35 real dataset demonstrated improvement of the RMSE and SSIM by 29% and 8% for LD to FD, 40% and 7% for LD+MRI to FD, 16% and 8% for NAC to MAC, and 24% and 11% for MRI to CT mapping task, respectively. The qualitative/quantitative analysis demonstrated that the proposed model improved the performance of all four DNN models through producing images of higher quality and lower quantitative bias and variance compared to reference images.",

        "abstract": "This work introduces an alternative approach, leveraging free, noisy data from the web and simple, generic methods of recognition, and demonstrates its efficacy on four fine-grained datasets, greatly exceeding existing state of the art without the manual collection of even a single label. Current approaches for fine-grained recognition do the following: First, recruit experts to annotate a dataset of images, optionally also collecting more structured data in the form of part annotations and bounding boxes. Second, train a model utilizing this data. Toward the goal of solving fine-grained recognition, we introduce an alternative approach, leveraging free, noisy data from the web and simple, generic methods of recognition. This approach has benefits in both performance and scalability. We demonstrate its efficacy on four fine-grained datasets, greatly exceeding existing state of the art without the manual collection of even a single label, and furthermore show first results at scaling to more than 10,000 fine-grained categories. Quantitatively, we achieve top-1 accuracies of \\(92.3\\,\\%\\) on CUB-200-2011, \\(85.4\\,\\%\\) on Birdsnap, \\(93.4\\,\\%\\) on FGVC-Aircraft, and \\(80.8\\,\\%\\) on Stanford Dogs without using their annotated training sets. We compare our approach to an active learning approach for expanding fine-grained datasets.",

        "abstract": "A method for classifying dementia images by applying 18F-Florbetaben positron emission tomography images to ViT, and results show that it is hard to argue that the ViT model is better at AD classification than the CNN model. Dementia is a degenerative disease that is increasingly prevalent in an aging society. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is best mitigated via early detection and management. Deep learning is an artificial intelligence technique that has been used to diagnose and predict diseases by extracting meaningful features from medical images. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is a representative application of deep learning, serving as a powerful tool for the diagnosis of AD. Recently, vision transformers (ViT) have yielded classification performance exceeding that of CNN in some diagnostic image classifications. Because the brain is a very complex network with interrelated regions, ViT, which captures direct relationships between images, may be more effective for brain image analysis than CNN. Therefore, we propose a method for classifying dementia images by applying 18F-Florbetaben positron emission tomography (PET) images to ViT. Data were evaluated via binary (normal control and abnormal) and ternary (healthy control, mild cognitive impairment, and AD) classification. In a performance comparison with the CNN, VGG19 was selected as the comparison model. Consequently, ViT yielded more effective performance than VGG19 in binary classification. However, in ternary classification, the performance of ViT cannot be considered excellent. These results show that it is hard to argue that the ViT model is better at AD classification than the CNN model.",

        "abstract": "An end-to-end framework for early detection of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and medical image classification for various AD stages is designed using convolutional neural networks based on 2D and 3D convolution. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a chronic, irreversible brain disorder, no effective cure for it till now. However, available medicines can delay its progress. Therefore, the early detection of AD plays a crucial role in preventing and controlling its progression. The main objective is to design an end-to-end framework for early detection of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and medical image classification for various AD stages. A deep learning approach, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), is used in this work. Four stages of the AD spectrum are multi-classified. Furthermore, separate binary medical image classifications are implemented between each two-pair class of AD stages. Two methods are used to classify the medical images and detect AD. The first method uses simple CNN architectures that deal with 2D and 3D structural brain scans from the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset based on 2D and 3D convolution. The second method applies the transfer learning principle to take advantage of the pre-trained models for medical image classifications, such as the VGG19 model. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult for people to go to hospitals periodically to avoid gatherings and infections. As a result, Alzheimer\u2019s checking web application is proposed using the final qualified proposed architectures. It helps doctors and patients to check AD remotely. It also determines the AD stage of the patient based on the AD spectrum and advises the patient according to its AD stage. Nine performance metrics are used in the evaluation and the comparison between the two methods. The experimental results prove that the CNN architectures for the first method have the following characteristics: suitable simple structures that reduce computational complexity, memory requirements, overfitting, and provide manageable time. Besides, they achieve very promising accuracies, 93.61% and 95.17% for 2D and 3D multi-class AD stage classifications. The VGG19 pre-trained model is fine-tuned and achieved an accuracy of 97% for multi-class AD stage classifications.",

        "abstract": "This approach supports the value of well-performing machine learning and linguistically-focussed processing techniques to detect AD from speech and highlights the need to compare model performance on carefully balanced datasets in order to determine the best performing predictive model. Introduction: Research related to the automatic detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important, given the high prevalence of AD and the high cost of traditional diagnostic methods. Since AD significantly affects the content and acoustics of spontaneous speech, natural language processing, and machine learning provide promising techniques for reliably detecting AD. There has been a recent proliferation of classification models for AD, but these vary in the datasets used, model types and training and testing paradigms. In this study, we compare and contrast the performance of two common approaches for automatic AD detection from speech on the same, well-matched dataset, to determine the advantages of using domain knowledge vs. pre-trained transfer models. Methods: Audio recordings and corresponding manually-transcribed speech transcripts of a picture description task administered to 156 demographically matched older adults, 78 with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and 78 cognitively intact (healthy) were classified using machine learning and natural language processing as \u201cAD\u201d or \u201cnon-AD.\u201d The audio was acoustically-enhanced, and post-processed to improve quality of the speech recording as well control for variation caused by recording conditions. Two approaches were used for classification of these speech samples: (1) using domain knowledge: extracting an extensive set of clinically relevant linguistic and acoustic features derived from speech and transcripts based on prior literature, and (2) using transfer-learning and leveraging large pre-trained machine learning models: using transcript-representations that are automatically derived from state-of-the-art pre-trained language models, by fine-tuning Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT)-based sequence classification models. Results: We compared the utility of speech transcript representations obtained from recent natural language processing models (i.e., BERT) to more clinically-interpretable language feature-based methods. Both the feature-based approaches and fine-tuned BERT models significantly outperformed the baseline linguistic model using a small set of linguistic features, demonstrating the importance of extensive linguistic information for detecting cognitive impairments relating to AD. We observed that fine-tuned BERT models numerically outperformed feature-based approaches on the AD detection task, but the difference was not statistically significant. Our main contribution is the observation that when tested on the same, demographically balanced dataset and tested on independent, unseen data, both domain knowledge and pretrained linguistic models have good predictive performance for detecting AD based on speech. It is notable that linguistic information alone is capable of achieving comparable, and even numerically better, performance than models including both acoustic and linguistic features here. We also try to shed light on the inner workings of the more black-box natural language processing model by performing an interpretability analysis, and find that attention weights reveal interesting patterns such as higher attribution to more important information content units in the picture description task, as well as pauses and filler words. Conclusion: This approach supports the value of well-performing machine learning and linguistically-focussed processing techniques to detect AD from speech and highlights the need to compare model performance on carefully balanced datasets, using consistent same training parameters and independent test datasets in order to determine the best performing predictive model.",

        "abstract": "This work uses NLP techniques to classify and analyze the linguistic characteristics ofAD patients using the DementiaBank dataset, and shows that first derivative saliency can not only rediscover previous language patterns of AD patients, but also shed light on the limitations of neural models. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is an irreversible and progressive brain disease that can be stopped or slowed down with medical treatment. Language changes serve as a sign that a patient\u2019s cognitive functions have been impacted, potentially leading to early diagnosis. In this work, we use NLP techniques to classify and analyze the linguistic characteristics of AD patients using the DementiaBank dataset. We apply three neural models based on CNNs, LSTM-RNNs, and their combination, to distinguish between language samples from AD and control patients. We achieve a new independent benchmark accuracy for the AD classification task. More importantly, we next interpret what these neural models have learned about the linguistic characteristics of AD patients, via analysis based on activation clustering and first-derivative saliency techniques. We then perform novel automatic pattern discovery inside activation clusters, and consolidate AD patients\u2019 distinctive grammar patterns. Additionally, we show that first derivative saliency can not only rediscover previous language patterns of AD patients, but also shed light on the limitations of neural models. Lastly, we also include analysis of gender-separated AD data.",

        "abstract": "A convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) for automated brain disease classification with rs-fMRI data is proposed using a sliding window strategy and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in binary and multi-category classification tasks. Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) networks derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) help us understand fundamental dynamic characteristics of human brains, thereby providing an efficient solution for automated identification of brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage. Existing studies have applied deep learning methods to dFC network analysis and achieved good performance compared with traditional machine learning methods. However, they seldom take advantage of sequential information conveyed in dFC networks that could be informative to improve the diagnosis performance. In this paper, we propose a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) for automated brain disease classification with rs-fMRI data. Specifically, we first construct dFC networks from rs-fMRI data using a sliding window strategy. Then, we employ three convolutional layers and long short-term memory (LSTM) layer to extract high-level features of dFC networks and also preserve the sequential information of extracted features, followed by three fully connected layers for brain disease classification. Experimental results on 174 subjects with 563 rs-fMRI scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in binary and multi-category classification tasks.",

With the enhancement in agricultural technology and the use of artificial intelligence in diagnosing plant diseases, it becomes important to make pertinent research to sustainable agricultural development. Various diseases like early blight and late blight immensely influence the quality and quantity of the potatoes and manual interpretation of these leaf diseases is quite time-taking and cumbersome. As it requires tremendously a good level of expertise, efficient and automated detection of these diseases in the budding phase can assist in ameliorating the potato crop production. Previously, various models have been proposed to detect several plant diseases. In this paper, a model is presented that uses pre-trained models like VGG19 for fine-tuning(transfer learning) to extract the relevant features from the dataset. Then, with the help of multiple classifiers results were perceived among which logistic regression outperformed others by a substantial margin of classification accuracy obtaining 97.8% over the test dataset.",

        "abstract": "In evaluations on a multilingual corpus of older French, Dutch, and German participants, it is shown that the multilingual learning approaches for MCI classification from the SVF clearly improve over single-language baselines. The Semantic Verbal Fluency Task (SVF) is an efficient and minimally invasive speech-based screening tool for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). In the SVF, testees have to produce as many words for a given semantic category as possible within 60 seconds. State-of-the-art approaches for automatic evaluation of the SVF employ word embeddings to analyze semantic similarities in these word sequences. While these approaches have proven promising in a variety of test languages, the small amount of data available for any given language limits the performance. In this paper, we for the first time investigate multilingual learning approaches for MCI classification from the SVF in order to combat data scarcity. To allow for cross-language generalisation, these approaches either rely on translation to a shared language, or make use of several distinct word embeddings. In evaluations on a multilingual corpus of older French, Dutch, and German participants (Controls=66, MCI=66), we show that our multilingual approaches clearly improve over single-language baselines.",

        "abstract": "DiffPack is presented, a torsional diffusion model that learns the joint distribution of side-chainTorsional angles, the only degrees of freedom in side- chain packing, by diffusing and denoising on the torsion space. Proteins play a critical role in carrying out biological functions, and their 3D structures are essential in determining their functions. Accurately predicting the conformation of protein side-chains given their backbones is important for applications in protein structure prediction, design and protein-protein interactions. Traditional methods are computationally intensive and have limited accuracy, while existing machine learning methods treat the problem as a regression task and overlook the restrictions imposed by the constant covalent bond lengths and angles. In this work, we present DiffPack, a torsional diffusion model that learns the joint distribution of side-chain torsional angles, the only degrees of freedom in side-chain packing, by diffusing and denoising on the torsional space. To avoid issues arising from simultaneous perturbation of all four torsional angles, we propose autoregressively generating the four torsional angles from \\c{hi}1 to \\c{hi}4 and training diffusion models for each torsional angle. We evaluate the method on several benchmarks for protein side-chain packing and show that our method achieves improvements of 11.9% and 13.5% in angle accuracy on CASP13 and CASP14, respectively, with a significantly smaller model size (60x fewer parameters). Additionally, we show the effectiveness of our method in enhancing side-chain predictions in the AlphaFold2 model. Code will be available upon the accept.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes CooK, a novel framework to empower general-purpose large language models with modular and collaboratively sourced knowledge, and proposes three knowledge filters to dynamically select and retain information in generated documents by controlling for relevance, brevity, and factuality. Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for knowledge-intensive tasks and contexts. Existing approaches improve the knowledge capabilities of general-purpose LLMs through retrieval or generated knowledge prompting, but they fall short of reflecting two key properties of knowledge-rich models: knowledge should be modular, ever-growing, sourced from diverse domains; knowledge acquisition and production should be a collaborative process, where diverse stakeholders contribute new information. To this end, we propose CooK, a novel framework to empower general-purpose large language models with modular and collaboratively sourced knowledge. We first introduce specialized language models, autoregressive models trained on corpora from a wide range of domains and sources. These specialized LMs serve as parametric knowledge repositories that are later prompted to generate background knowledge for general-purpose LLMs. We then propose three knowledge filters to dynamically select and retain information in generated documents by controlling for relevance, brevity, and factuality. Finally, we propose bottom-up and top-down knowledge integration approaches to augment general-purpose LLMs with the curated (relevant, factual) knowledge from community-driven specialized LMs that enable multi-domain knowledge synthesis and on-demand knowledge requests. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CooK achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmark datasets. Our results highlight the potential of enriching general-purpose LLMs with evolving and modular knowledge -- relevant knowledge that can be continuously updated through the collective efforts of the research community.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a Patient Knowledge Distillation approach to compress an original large model (teacher) into an equally-effective lightweight shallow network (student), which translates into improved results on multiple NLP tasks with a significant gain in training efficiency, without sacrificing model accuracy. Pre-trained language models such as BERT have proven to be highly effective for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the high demand for computing resources in training such models hinders their application in practice. In order to alleviate this resource hunger in large-scale model training, we propose a Patient Knowledge Distillation approach to compress an original large model (teacher) into an equally-effective lightweight shallow network (student). Different from previous knowledge distillation methods, which only use the output from the last layer of the teacher network for distillation, our student model patiently learns from multiple intermediate layers of the teacher model for incremental knowledge extraction, following two strategies: (i) PKD-Last: learning from the last k layers; and (ii) PKD-Skip: learning from every k layers. These two patient distillation schemes enable the exploitation of rich information in the teacher\u2019s hidden layers, and encourage the student model to patiently learn from and imitate the teacher through a multi-layer distillation process. Empirically, this translates into improved results on multiple NLP tasks with a significant gain in training efficiency, without sacrificing model accuracy.",

Commonsense knowledge graph support applications in commonsense reasoning, question answering, and so on. However, automatic knowledge graph construction is still a continuing goal for AI researchers due to the difficulty of obtaining tractable and objective commonsense information. Besides, the relative researches have so far been mainly limited to English, making it slow to develop the research of commonsense knowledge in other languages. Previous studies constructed the knowledge bases as the relational schemas which use the expert knowledge, semi-structured text extraction and unstructured text extraction. However, with the way of extraction, these methods can only capture the explicit knowledge mentioned in the text, while the commonsense knowledge in the text is usually implicit. In this paper, we propose a commonsense generative model with a novel attention mechanism and discuss whether pre-trained language models can effectively learn and generate novel knowledge. The empirical results show that our model could generate correct commonsense knowledge with high scores which up to 50.10% precision on ATOMIC dataset humans given.",

        "abstract": "ZELDA is presented, a novel entity disambiguation benchmark that includes a unified training data set, entity vocabulary, candidate lists, as well as challenging evaluation splits covering 8 different domains, and is made publicly available to the research community. Entity disambiguation (ED) is the task of disambiguating named entity mentions in text to unique entries in a knowledge base. Due to its industrial relevance, as well as current progress in leveraging pre-trained language models, a multitude of ED approaches have been proposed in recent years. However, we observe a severe lack of uniformity across experimental setups in current ED work,rendering a direct comparison of approaches based solely on reported numbers impossible: Current approaches widely differ in the data set used to train, the size of the covered entity vocabulary, and the usage of additional signals such as candidate lists. To address this issue, we present ZELDA , a novel entity disambiguation benchmark that includes a unified training data set, entity vocabulary, candidate lists, as well as challenging evaluation splits covering 8 different domains. We illustrate its design and construction, and present experiments in which we train and compare current state-of-the-art approaches on our benchmark. To encourage greater direct comparability in the entity disambiguation domain, we make our benchmark publicly available to the research community.",

        "abstract": "These cardiac models have improved heart disease modeling and toxicological evaluation, and the strategies to enhance their complexity and maturity are discussed. Heart disease is one of the major life-threatening diseases with high mortality and incidence worldwide. Several model systems, such as primary cells and animals, have been used to understand heart diseases and establish appropriate treatments. However, they have limitations in accuracy and reproducibility in recapitulating disease pathophysiology and evaluating drug responses. In recent years, three-dimensional (3D) cardiac tissue models produced using tissue engineering technology and human cells have outperformed conventional models. In particular, the integration of cell reprogramming techniques with bioengineering platforms (e.g., microfluidics, scaffolds, bioprinting, and biophysical stimuli) has facilitated the development of heart-on-a-chip, cardiac spheroid/organoid, and engineered heart tissue (EHT) to recapitulate the structural and functional features of the native human heart. These cardiac models have improved heart disease modeling and toxicological evaluation. In this review, we summarize the cell types for the fabrication of cardiac tissue models, introduce diverse 3D human cardiac tissue models, and discuss the strategies to enhance their complexity and maturity. Finally, recent studies in the modeling of various heart diseases are reviewed.",

        "abstract": "A deep learning-based AC/SC model for PET images using data emanating from 6 different centers without sharing the datasets is built using a deep residual network as the main architecture. Scatter compensation (SC) and attenuation correction (AC) are vital steps towards quantitative PET image analysis. Recently deep learning algorithms were applied in the image domain for SC and AC. To build a generalizable and reproducible deep learning model a large dataset is needed to tune millions of model parameters. Because of the sensitivity of medical images and strict regulations, gathering a large dataset for deep learning model training is the main challenge in medical applications. In this work, non-attenuation corrected, and CT-based attenuation corrected 18F-FDG PET images of 300 patients were enrolled. Data consisted of 50 patients from 6 different centers which scanners, image acquisition, and reconstruction vary across the different centers. We used a deep residual network as the main architecture. The network consists of twenty convolutional layers in which feature extraction (low, medium, and high) was performed by dilation kernel. For model evaluation, voxel-wise mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), relative error (RE%), absolute relative error (ARE%) and structural similarity index (SSIM) were calculated between ground truth CT-based attenuation/scatter corrected and predicted PET images. We implemented server aggregate federated learning workflow, which included 3 steps: (1) central global model distributed through different departments, then (2) models will be trained in each center separately and finally (3) local trained models returned to central server and model aggregated as central global models. Steps 1-3 are repeated until the model is fully trained and converged. Quantitative analysis showed ME of 0.05\u00b10.1, MAE of 0.43\u00b10.01, RE of 2.74\u00b15.7%, ARE of 15.0\u00b18.8% and SSIM of 0. 90\u00b10.09 in the test set. In this study, we built a deep learning-based AC/SC model for PET images using data emanating from 6 different centers without sharing the datasets. Federated learning algorithms provide the opportunity to build a model using multicenter datasets without sharing data.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a data-driven meta-set based approach to deal with noisy web images for fine-grained recognition that can alleviate the harmful effects caused by out-of-distribution noise and properly exploit the in-dist distribution noisy samples for training. Constructing fine-grained image datasets typically requires domain-specific expert knowledge, which is not always available for crowd-sourcing platform annotators. Accordingly, learning directly from web images becomes an alternative method for fine-grained visual recognition. However, label noise in the web training set can severely degrade the model performance. To this end, we propose a data-driven meta-set based approach to deal with noisy web images for fine-grained recognition. Specifically, guided by a small amount of clean meta-set, we train a selection net in a meta-learning manner to distinguish in- and out-of-distribution noisy images. To further boost the robustness of the model, we also learn a labeling net to correct the labels of in-distribution noisy data. In this way, our proposed method can alleviate the harmful effects caused by out-of-distribution noise and properly exploit the in-distribution noisy samples for training. Extensive experiments on three commonly used fine-grained datasets demonstrate that our approach is much superior to state-of-the-art noise-robust methods.",

Mental illness is highly prevalent nowadays, constituting a major cause of distress in people\u2019s life with impact on society\u2019s health and well-being. Mental illness is a complex multi-factorial disease associated with individual risk factors and a variety of socioeconomic, clinical associations. In order to capture these complex associations expressed in a wide variety of textual data, including social media posts, interviews, and clinical notes, natural language processing (NLP) methods demonstrate promising improvements to empower proactive mental healthcare and assist early diagnosis. We provide a narrative review of mental illness detection using NLP in the past decade, to understand methods, trends, challenges and future directions. A total of 399 studies from 10,467 records were included. The review reveals that there is an upward trend in mental illness detection NLP research. Deep learning methods receive more attention and perform better than traditional machine learning methods. We also provide some recommendations for future studies, including the development of novel detection methods, deep learning paradigms and interpretable models.",

        "abstract": "This research investigated for the first time, to the knowledge, three current and promising deep convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet) and two transformer-based architectures (MAE and DeiT) for mapping input images to clinical diagnosis. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can help in the early detection of associated cognitive impairment. The aim of this work is to improve the automatic detection of dementia in MRI brain data. For this purpose, we used an established pipeline that includes the registration, slicing, and classification steps. The contribution of this research was to investigate for the first time, to our knowledge, three current and promising deep convolutional models (ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet) and two transformer-based architectures (MAE and DeiT) for mapping input images to clinical diagnosis. To allow a fair comparison, the experiments were performed on two publicly available datasets (ADNI and OASIS) using multiple benchmarks obtained by changing the number of slices per subject extracted from the available 3D voxels. The experiments showed that very deep ResNet and DenseNet models performed better than the shallow ResNet and VGG versions tested in the literature. It was also found that transformer architectures, and DeiT in particular, produced the best classification results and were more robust to the noise added by increasing the number of slices. A significant improvement in accuracy (up to 7%) was achieved compared to the leading state-of-the-art approaches, paving the way for the use of CAD approaches in real-world applications.",

With the rapid growth of social media platforms, digitization of official records, and digital publication of articles, books, magazines, and newspapers, lots of data are generated every day. This data is a foundation of information and contains a vast amount of text that may be complex, ambiguous, redundant, irrelevant, and unstructured. Therefore, we require tools and methods that can help us understand and automatically summarize the vast amount of generated text. There are mainly two types of approaches to perform text summarization: abstractive and extractive. In Abstractive Text Summarization, a concise summary is generated by including the salient features of the input documents and paraphrasing documents using new sentences and phrases. While in Extractive Text Summarization, a summary is produced by selecting and combining the most significant sentences and phrases from the source documents. The researchers have given numerous techniques for both kinds of text summarization. In this work, we classify Extractive Text Summarization approaches and review them based on their characteristics, techniques, and performance. We have discussed the existing Extractive Text Summarization approaches along with their limitations. We also classify and discuss evaluation measures and provide the research challenges faced in Extractive Text Summarization.",

The presented paper introduces principal component analysis application for dimensionality reduction of variables describing speech signal and applicability of obtained results for the disturbed and fluent speech recognition process. A set of fluent speech signals and three speech disturbances\u2014blocks before words starting with plosives, syllable repetitions, and sound-initial prolongations\u2014was transformed using principal component analysis. The result was a model containing four principal components describing analysed utterances. Distances between standardised original variables and elements of the observation matrix in a new system of coordinates were calculated and then applied in the recognition process. As a classifying algorithm, the multilayer perceptron network was used. Achieved results were compared with outcomes from previous experiments where speech samples were parameterised with the Kohonen network application. The classifying network achieved overall accuracy at 76% (from 50% to 91%, depending on the dysfluency type).",

        "abstract": "A set of curated features, a modular and extensible Feature Extraction framework, and a Performance Evaluation framework are proposed to solve the reproducibility and comparability of previous results in this research domain. Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurode-generative disease that has no cure. Early detection is critical to slow its development, but the diagnosis process is lengthy and costly. Computer-Aided Dementia Detection through Natural Language Processing is emerging as a viable solution for an early diagnosis. Many works in the literature use transcripts of the conversations from the famous DementiaBank dataset to train and test Machine Learning models to detect Dementia automatically. However, the reproducibility and comparability of previous results have been a significant problem in this research domain. We propose a set of curated features, a modular and extensible Feature Extraction framework, and a Performance Evaluation framework to solve these problems. We then evaluated the baseline performance of 12 Machine Learning algorithms over three different tasks: Regression, Binary Classification, and Multiclass Classification with 3, 4, and 5 classes. The top performer model was the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, achieving an RMSE of 4.3 for the Regression task, an Accuracy of 0.78 for the Binary classification task, and an Accuracy of respectively 0.63, 0.64, and 0.49 for the 3, 4, and 5 classes Multiclass Classification tasks.",

        "abstract": "The analyses suggest that the combination of automatic transcription and BERT may produce a significant performance in AD related detection and prediction problems. With the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), it is important to develop detectable biomarkers to reliably identify AD in the early stage. Language deficit is one of the common signs that appear in the early stage of mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Therefore, using natural language processing and related machine learning algorithms for AD diagnosis using patients\u2019 speech recordings has drawn more attention in recent years. In this study, three approaches are proposed to extract features through speech recording in this model: (1) using fine-tuning pre-trained encoder model (BERT) for transcripts from automatic transcription, (2) hand-crafted linguistic features for transcripts from automatic transcription, and (3) selected acoustic features for denoised speech recordings. The three designed approaches are applied to three tasks: AD diagnosis, MMSE score prediction, and cognitive decline inference. The approach using BERT yields the best performance in all three challenge tasks based on cross-validation results using the training dataset. Specifically, in the AD diagnosis task, 5-fold cross-validation using encoded features based on transcripts generated from Deep Speech yields an average classification accuracy of 97.18%. In the MMSE score prediction task, 5-fold cross-validation using BERT encoded features based on transcripts generated from Deep Speech yields an average Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 3.76. In the cognitive decline inference task, the leave-one-out cross-validation using BERT encoded features based on transcripts generated from Sphinx or Deep Speech yields an average classification accuracy of 100%. The analyses suggest that the combination of automatic transcription and BERT may produce a significant performance in AD related detection and prediction problems.",

        "abstract": "The available evidence suggests that dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) can capture time-varying abnormalities in brain activity in resting-state cerebral functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data and has a natural advantage in uncovering mechanisms of abnormal brain activity in schizophrenia(SZ) patients. Hence, an advanced dynamic brain network analysis model called the temporal brain category graph convolutional network (Temporal-BCGCN) was employed. Firstly, a unique dynamic brain network analysis module, DSF-BrainNet, was designed to construct dynamic synchronization features. Subsequently, a revolutionary graph convolution method, TemporalConv, was proposed, based on the synchronous temporal properties of feature. Finally, the first modular abnormal hemispherical lateralization test tool in deep learning based on rs-fMRI data, named CategoryPool, was proposed. This study was validated on COBRE and UCLA datasets and achieved 83.62% and 89.71% average accuracies, respectively, outperforming the baseline model and other state-of-the-art methods. The ablation results also demonstrate the advantages of TemporalConv over the traditional edge feature graph convolution approach and the improvement of CategoryPool over the classical graph pooling approach. Interestingly, this study showed that the lower order perceptual system and higher order network regions in the left hemisphere are more severely dysfunctional than in the right hemisphere in SZ and reaffirms the importance of the left medial superior frontal gyrus in SZ.

        "abstract": "A model for automatic plant disease identification based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to categories potato leaves into his three classes-healthy leaves, early blight and late blight is provided. During the growth season, several illnesses can affect plants. One of the most significant issues in agriculture is the early diagnosis of plant diseases. Diseases can diminish total yields and farmers' income if they are not identified early enough. Reducing plant diseases and enhancing the quality and yield of food crops can both benefit from early and accurate analysis and identification of plant diseases. Since there aren't any potato disease experts in remote places, an automated, affordable, usable, and trustworthy method is needed to diagnose plant diseases without the use of laboratory testing or expert judgement. To overcome this problem, many researchers have presented approaches based on deep learning and machine learning. However, most of these systems either use millions of training parameters or have poor classification accuracy. In this paper, we provide a model for automatic plant disease identification based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). To categories potato leaves into his three classes-healthy leaves, early blight and late blight. CNN devised a methodology. This work makes use of 5162 original image dataset and 82,592 augmented images. CNN models have a classification accuracy of 98.07% and can automatically learn features from raw photos. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and other deep learning techniques can be used to detect plant illnesses.",

        "abstract": "Based on transcribed speech samples from 100 French elderly, 53 diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment and 47 healthy, distributional semantic models are used to cluster words in each sample and compare performance with a taxonomic baseline approach in a realistic classification task. The Semantic Verbal Fluency Task is a common neuropsychological assessment for cognitive disorders: patients are prompted to name as many words from a semantic category as possible in a time interval; the count of correctly named concepts is assessed. Patients often organise their retrieval around semantically related clusters. The definition of clusters is usually based on handmade taxonomies and the patient's performance is manually evaluated. In order to overcome limitations of such an approach, we propose a statistical method using distributional semantics. Based on transcribed speech samples from 100 French elderly, 53 diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment and 47 healthy, we used distributional semantic models to cluster words in each sample and compare performance with a taxonomic baseline approach in a realistic classification task. The distributional models outperform the baseline. Comparing different linguistic corpora as basis for the models, our results indicate that models trained on larger corpora perform better.",

Prediction of side chain conformations of amino acids in proteins (also termed \u2018packing\u2019) is an important and challenging part of protein structure prediction with many interesting applications in protein design. A variety of methods for packing have been developed but more accurate ones are still needed. Machine learning (ML) methods have recently become a powerful tool for solving various problems in diverse areas of science, including structural biology. In this work we evaluate the potential of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for prediction of amino acid side chain conformations. We formulate the problem as image-to-image transformation and train a U-net style DNN to solve the problem. We show that our method outperforms other physics-based methods by a significant margin: reconstruction RMSDs for most amino acids are about 20% smaller compared to SCWRL4 and Rosetta Packer with RMSDs for bulky hydrophobic amino acids Phe, Tyr and Trp being up to 50% smaller.",

        "abstract": "The method generate-then-read (GenRead), which first prompts a large language model to generate contextutal documents based on a given question, and then reads the generated documents to produce the final answer, is called. Knowledge-intensive tasks, such as open-domain question answering (QA), require access to a large amount of world or domain knowledge. A common approach for knowledge-intensive tasks is to employ a retrieve-then-read pipeline that first retrieves a handful of relevant contextual documents from an external corpus such as Wikipedia and then predicts an answer conditioned on the retrieved documents. In this paper, we present a novel perspective for solving knowledge-intensive tasks by replacing document retrievers with large language model generators. We call our method generate-then-read (GenRead), which first prompts a large language model to generate contextutal documents based on a given question, and then reads the generated documents to produce the final answer. Furthermore, we propose a novel clustering-based prompting method that selects distinct prompts, resulting in the generated documents that cover different perspectives, leading to better recall over acceptable answers. We conduct extensive experiments on three different knowledge-intensive tasks, including open-domain QA, fact checking, and dialogue system. Notably, GenRead achieves 71.6 and 54.4 exact match scores on TriviaQA and WebQ, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieve-then-read pipeline DPR-FiD by +4.0 and +3.9, without retrieving any documents from any external knowledge source. Lastly, we demonstrate the model performance can be further improved by combining retrieval and generation. Our code and generated documents can be found at https://github.com/wyu97/GenRead.",

        "abstract": "The proposed method only needs to calculate the first-order derivatives to update the teacher, leading to lower computational cost but better convergence, and the teacher can continuously meta-learn the student's learning objective to adjust its parameters for maximizing the student\u2019s performance throughout the distillation process. The billions, and sometimes even trillions, of parameters involved in pre-trained language models significantly hamper their deployment in resource-constrained devices and real-time applications. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer knowledge from the original model (i.e., teacher) into a compact model (i.e., student) to achieve model compression. However, previous KD methods have usually frozen the teacher and applied its immutable output feature maps as soft labels to guide the student\u2019s training. Moreover, the goal of the teacher is to achieve the best performance on downstream tasks rather than knowledge transfer. Such a fixed architecture may limit the teacher\u2019s teaching and student\u2019s learning abilities. Herein, a knowledge distillation method with reptile meta-learning is proposed to facilitate the transfer of knowledge from the teacher to the student. The teacher can continuously meta-learn the student\u2019s learning objective to adjust its parameters for maximizing the student\u2019s performance throughout the distillation process. In this way, the teacher learns to teach, produces more suitable soft labels, and transfers more appropriate knowledge to the student, resulting in improved performance. Unlike previous KD using meta-learning, the proposed method only needs to calculate the first-order derivatives to update the teacher, leading to lower computational cost but better convergence. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark show the competitive performance achieved by the proposed method.

        "abstract": "This work introduces Cross-lingual Choice of Plausible Alternatives (XCOPA), a typologically diverse multilingual dataset for causal commonsense reasoning in 11 languages, revealing that current methods based on multilingual pretraining and zero-shot fine-tuning transfer suffer from the curse of multilinguality and fall short of performance in monolingual settings by a large margin. In order to simulate human language capacity, natural language processing systems must complement the explicit information derived from raw text with the ability to reason about the possible causes and outcomes of everyday situations. Moreover, the acquired world knowledge should generalise to new languages, modulo cultural differences. Advances in machine commonsense reasoning and cross-lingual transfer depend on the availability of challenging evaluation benchmarks. Motivated by both demands, we introduce Cross-lingual Choice of Plausible Alternatives (XCOPA), a typologically diverse multilingual dataset for causal commonsense reasoning in 11 languages. We benchmark a range of state-of-the-art models on this novel dataset, revealing that current methods based on multilingual pretraining and zero-shot fine-tuning transfer suffer from the curse of multilinguality and fall short of performance in monolingual settings by a large margin. Finally, we propose ways to adapt these models to out-of-sample resource-lean languages where only a small corpus or a bilingual dictionary is available, and report substantial improvements over the random baseline. XCOPA is available at this http URL.",

        "abstract": "The results show that the edge computing clonal node method based on machine learning can improve the detection success rate of clonal nodes and reduce the energy consumption and transmission overhead of nodes, which is of great significance to the detection ofClonal nodes. Edge computing is an important cornerstone for the construction of 5G networks, but with the development of Internet technology, the computer nodes are extremely vulnerable in attacks, especially clone attacks, causing casualties. The principle of clonal node attack is that the attacker captures the legitimate nodes in the network and obtains all their legitimate information, copies several nodes with the same ID and key information, and puts these clonal nodes in different locations in the network to attack the edge computing devices, resulting in network paralysis. How to quickly and efficiently identify clone nodes and isolate them becomes the key to prevent clone node attacks and improve the security of edge computing. In order to improve the degree of protection of edge computing and identify clonal nodes more quickly and accurately, based on edge computing of machine learning, this paper uses case analysis method, the literature analysis method, and other methods to collect data from the database, and uses parallel algorithm to build a model of clonal node recognition. The results show that the edge computing based on machine learning can greatly improve the efficiency of clonal node recognition, the recognition speed is more than 30% faster than the traditional edge computing, and the recognition accuracy reaches 0.852, which is about 50% higher than the traditional recognition. The results show that the edge computing clonal node method based on machine learning can improve the detection success rate of clonal nodes and reduce the energy consumption and transmission overhead of nodes, which is of great significance to the detection of clonal nodes.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes ExtEnD, a novel local formulation for ED where it frame this task as a text extraction problem, and presents two Transformer-based architectures that implement it, and finds this approach surpasses all its competitors in terms of both data efficiency and raw performance. Local models for Entity Disambiguation (ED) have today become extremely powerful, in most part thanks to the advent of large pre-trained language models. However, despite their significant performance achievements, most of these approaches frame ED through classification formulations that have intrinsic limitations, both computationally and from a modeling perspective. In contrast with this trend, here we propose ExtEnD, a novel local formulation for ED where we frame this task as a text extraction problem, and present two Transformer-based architectures that implement it. Based on experiments in and out of domain, and training over two different data regimes, we find our approach surpasses all its competitors in terms of both data efficiency and raw performance. ExtEnD outperforms its alternatives by as few as 6 F1 points on the more constrained of the two data regimes and, when moving to the other higher-resourced regime, sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 4 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 F1 points overall and 1.1 F1 points out of domain. In addition, to gain better insights from our results, we also perform a fine-grained evaluation of our performances on different classes of label frequency, along with an ablation study of our architectural choices and an error analysis. We release our code and models for research purposes at https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/extend.",

The emergence of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and efficient differentiation of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) induced from diseased donors have the potential to recapitulate the molecular and functional features of the human heart. Although the immaturity of hiPSC-CMs, including the structure, gene expression, conduct, ion channel density, and Ca2+ kinetics, is a major challenge, various attempts to promote maturation have been effective. Three-dimensional cardiac models using hiPSC-CMs have achieved these functional and morphological maturations, and disease models using patient-specific hiPSC-CMs have furthered our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and effective therapies for diseases. Aside from the mechanisms of diseases and drug responses, hiPSC-CMs also have the potential to evaluate the safety and efficacy of drugs in a human context before a candidate drug enters the market and many phases of clinical trials. In fact, novel drug testing paradigms have suggested that these cells can be used to better predict the proarrhythmic risk of candidate drugs. In this review, we overview the current strategies of human engineered heart tissue models with a focus on major cardiac diseases and discuss perspectives and future directions for the real application of hiPSC-CMs and human engineered heart tissue for disease modeling, drug development, clinical trials, and cardiotoxicity tests.",

        "title": "Decentralized collaborative multi-institutional PET attenuation and scatter correction using federated deep learning",
        "abstract": "This work provided strong empirical evidence that the FL framework can fully benefit from the generalizability and robustness of DL models used for AC/SC in PET, while obviating the need for the direct sharing of datasets between clinical imaging centers. Purpose Attenuation correction and scatter compensation (AC/SC) are two main steps toward quantitative PET imaging, which remain challenging in PET-only and PET/MRI systems. These can be effectively tackled via deep learning (DL) methods. However, trustworthy, and generalizable DL models commonly require well-curated, heterogeneous, and large datasets from multiple clinical centers. At the same time, owing to legal/ethical issues and privacy concerns, forming a large collective, centralized dataset poses significant challenges. In this work, we aimed to develop a DL-based model in a multicenter setting without direct sharing of data using federated learning (FL) for AC/SC of PET images. Methods Non-attenuation/scatter corrected and CT-based attenuation/scatter corrected (CT-ASC) ^18F-FDG PET images of 300 patients were enrolled in this study. The dataset consisted of 6 different centers, each with 50 patients, with scanner, image acquisition, and reconstruction protocols varying across the centers. CT-based ASC PET images served as the standard reference. All images were reviewed to include high-quality and artifact-free PET images. Both corrected and uncorrected PET images were converted to standardized uptake values (SUVs). We used a modified nested U-Net utilizing residual U-block in a U-shape architecture. We evaluated two FL models, namely sequential (FL-SQ) and parallel (FL-PL) and compared their performance with the baseline centralized (CZ) learning model wherein the data were pooled to one server, as well as center-based (CB) models where for each center the model was built and evaluated separately. Data from each center were divided to contribute to training (30 patients), validation (10 patients), and test sets (10 patients). Final evaluations and reports were performed on 60 patients (10 patients from each center). Results In terms of percent SUV absolute relative error (ARE%), both FL-SQ (CI:12.21\u201314.81%) and FL-PL (CI:11.82\u201313.84%) models demonstrated excellent agreement with the centralized framework (CI:10.32\u201312.00%), while FL-based algorithms improved model performance by over 11% compared to CB training strategy (CI: 22.34\u201326.10%). Furthermore, the Mann\u2013Whitney test between different strategies revealed no significant differences between CZ and FL-based algorithms ( p -value\u2009>\u20090.05) in center-categorized mode. At the same time, a significant difference was observed between the different training approaches on the overall dataset ( p -value\u2009<\u20090.05). In addition, voxel-wise comparison, with respect to reference CT-ASC, exhibited similar performance for images predicted by CZ ( R ^2\u2009=\u20090.94), FL-SQ ( R ^2\u2009=\u20090.93), and FL-PL ( R ^2\u2009=\u20090.92), while CB model achieved a far lower coefficient of determination ( R ^2\u2009=\u20090.74). Despite the strong correlations between CZ and FL-based methods compared to reference CT-ASC, a slight underestimation of predicted voxel values was observed. Conclusion Deep learning-based models provide promising results toward quantitative PET image reconstruction. Specifically, we developed two FL models and compared their performance with center-based and centralized models. The proposed FL-based models achieved higher performance compared to center-based models, comparable with centralized models. Our work provided strong empirical evidence that the FL framework can fully benefit from the generalizability and robustness of DL models used for AC/SC in PET, while obviating the need for the direct sharing of datasets between clinical imaging centers.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach for removing irrelevant samples from real-world web images during training, while employing useful hard examples to update the network and demonstrates that this approach is far superior to current state-of-the-art web-supervised methods. Labeling objects at a subordinate level typically requires expert knowledge, which is not always available when using random annotators. As such, learning directly from web images for fine-grained recognition has attracted broad attention. However, the presence of label noise and hard examples in web images are two obstacles for training robust fine-grained recognition models. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel approach for removing irrelevant samples from real-world web images during training, while employing useful hard examples to update the network. Thus, our approach can alleviate the harmful effects of irrelevant noisy web images and hard examples to achieve better performance. Extensive experiments on three commonly used fine-grained datasets demonstrate that our approach is far superior to current state-of-the-art web-supervised methods.

Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) is becoming increasingly prevalent across the globe, and various diagnostic and detection methods have been developed in recent years. Several techniques are available, including Automatic Pipeline Methods and Machine Learning Methods that utilize Biomarker Methods, Fusion, and Registration for multimodality, to pre-process medical scans. The use of automated pipelines and machine learning systems has proven beneficial in accurately identifying AD and its stages, with a success rate of over 95% for single and binary class classifications. However, there are still challenges in multi-class classification, such as distinguishing between AD and MCI, as well as sub-stages of MCI.

In this era of growing digital media, the volume of text data increases day by day from various sources and may contain entire documents, books, articles, etc. This amount of text is a source of information that may be insignificant, redundant, and sometimes may not carry any meaningful representation. Therefore, we require some techniques and tools that can automatically summarize the enormous amounts of text data and help us to decide whether they are useful or not. Text summarization is a process that generates a brief version of the document in the form of a meaningful summary. It can be classified into abstractive text summarization and extractive text summarization. Abstractive text summarization generates an abstract type of summary from the given document. In extractive text summarization, a summary is created from the given document that contains crucial sentences of the document. Many authors proposed various techniques for both types of text summarization. This paper presents a survey of extractive text summarization on graphical-based techniques. Specifically, it focuses on unsupervised and supervised techniques. This paper shows the recent works and advances on them and focuses on the strength and weaknesses of surveys of previous works in tabular form. At last, it concentrates on the evaluation measure techniques of summary.",

        "abstract": "A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is proposed for Alzheimer\u2019s disease classification using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) samples and output classification result showed 98.57% accuracy compared to other studies. Deep learning methods have gained more popularity recently in medical image analysis. This work proposes a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for Alzheimer\u2019s disease classification using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) samples. Alzheimer disease (AD) is an irreversible neurological brain disorder; its early symptoms are memory loss and losing thinking abilities called cognitive functions. The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease at an early stage is very vital for patient care and conducting future treatment. Deep learning techniques are capable of learning high-level features from dataset compared to hand-crafted feature learning methods such as machine learning techniques. The proposed method classifies the disease as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normal control (NC). Spyder software obtained from anaconda bundle with Keras library and Tensorflow backend on GPU is used to model DCNN. Experiments are conducted using ADNI dataset and output classification result showed 98.57% accuracy compared to other studies. Our approach also enables us to expand this methodology to predict for more stages of disease classification.",

        "abstract": "Aim: This study focuses on the detection of Covid-19 via the use of cutting-edge speech recognition technology known as K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and comparing its accuracy with that of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Both the Materials and the Methods: In this case, speech recognition through the use of KNN is deemed to be group 1, while speech recognition via the use of an artificial neural network is considered to be group 2. ANN is comprised of several different components that are responsible for gathering the input signals and predefined functions that are responsible for creating the output signals. KNN works by calculating the distance between the query and the data and then picking the samples that are geographically closest to the requests. These various samples using algorithms were computationally assessed by a sampling test with 5% of alpha error and 0.95 of confidence interval. The results of this analysis are shown below. The findings show that ANN performs at a level of mean accuracy of 83.5%, whereas KNN performs at a level of mean accuracy of 91.49% with an error significance value of 0.03 (p 0.05). The findings that were acquired using KNN have shown much improved performance in terms of accuracy compared to those obtained using ANN.",

Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) is an irrecoverable, progressive neurodegenerative disorder that deteriorates the cognitive and linguistic abilities of a person over time. Ample research has been done on the early detection of AD; it remains a challenging task. Doctors use the patient\u2019s history, laboratory tests, and change in behaviour to diagnose the disease. Natural Language Processing(NLP) techniques can help automate the detection of AD, as Language impairments accompany this disease. This work aims to analyze the effect of different Embedding models on the DementiaBank dataset in order to detect the disease. The work uses both Generic and domain-specific Word Embeddings on the three deep learning models CNN, Bidirectional LSTM(BLSTM), and CNN+BLSTM. Results indicate that for a specific picture description task like cookie theft description, domain-specific Word Embeddings tend to work better. Lastly, it is discussed how results are affected by the use of different Embedding models (Fasttext, Word2Vec, GloVe).",

Detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) and disease progression based on the patient's speech not the patient's speech data can aid non-invasive, cost-effective, real-time early diagnostic and repetitive monitoring in minimum time and effort using machine learning (ML) classification approaches. This paper aims to predict early AD diagnosis and evaluate stages of AD through exploratory analysis of acoustic features, non-stationarity, and non-linearity testing, and applying data augmentation techniques on spontaneous speech signals collected from AD and cognitively normal (CN) subjects. Evaluation of the proposed AD prediction and AD stages classification models using Random Forest classifier yielded accuracy rates of 82.2% and 71.5%. This will enrich the Alzheimer's research community with further understanding of methods to improve models for AD classification and addressing non-stationarity and non-linearity properties on audio features to determine the best-suited acoustic features for AD monitoring.",

        "abstract": "A novel DFCNs construction and representation method is proposed that outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in the diagnosis of brain diseases and is validated on epilepsy and schizophrenia identification tasks. In recent years, numerous studies have adopted rs-fMRI to construct dynamic functional connectivity networks (DFCNs) and applied them to the diagnosis of brain diseases, such as epilepsy and schizophrenia. Compared with the static brain networks, the DFCNs have a natural advantage in reflecting the process of brain activity due to the time information contained in it. However, most of the current methods for constructing DFCNs fail to aggregate the brain topology structure and temporal variation of the functional architecture associated with brain regions, and often ignore the inherent multi-dimensional feature representation of DFCNs for classification. In order to address these issues, we propose a novel DFCNs construction and representation method and apply it to brain disease diagnosis. Specifically, we fuse the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal and interactions between brain regions to distinguish the brain topology within each time domain and across different time domains, by embedding block structure in the adjacency matrix. After that, a sparse tensor decomposition method with sparse local structure preserving regularization is developed to extract DFCNs features from a multi-dimensional perspective. Finally, the kernel discriminant analysis is employed to provide the decision result. We validate the proposed method on epilepsy and schizophrenia identification tasks, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in the diagnosis of brain diseases.",

        "abstract": "A multi-level deep learning model for potato leaf disease recognition has developed using a convolutional neural network to detect the early blight and late blight potato diseases from potato leaf images. Potato leaf disease detection in an early stage is challenging because of variations in crop species, crop diseases symptoms and environmental factors. These factors make it difficult to detect potato leaf diseases in the early stage. Various machine learning techniques have been developed to detect potato leaf diseases. However, the existing methods cannot detect crop species and crop diseases in general because these models are trained and tested on images of plant leaves of a specific region. In this research, a multi-level deep learning model for potato leaf disease recognition has developed. At the first level, it extracts the potato leaves from the potato plant image using the YOLOv5 image segmentation technique. At the second level, a novel deep learning technique has been developed using a convolutional neural network to detect the early blight and late blight potato diseases from potato leaf images. The proposed potato leaf disease detection model was trained and tested on a potato leaf disease dataset. The potato leaf disease dataset contains 4062 images collected from the Central Punjab region of Pakistan. The proposed deep learning technique achieved 99.75% accuracy on the potato leaf disease dataset. The performance of the proposed techniques was also evaluated on the PlantVillage dataset. The proposed technique is also compared with the state-of-the-art models and achieved significantly concerning the accuracy and computational cost.",

        "abstract": "Semantic Verbal Fluency (SVF) tests are common neuropsychological tasks, in which patients are asked to name as many words belonging to a semantic category as they can in 60 seconds. These tests are sensitive to even early forms of dementia caused by e.g. Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Performance is usually measured as the total number of correct responses. Clinical research has shown that not only the raw count, but also production strategy is a relevant clinical marker. We employed language modelling (LM) as a natural technique to model production in this task. Comparing different LMs, we show that perplexity of a persons SVF production predicts dementia well (F1 = 0.83). Demented patients show significantly lower perplexity, thus are more predictable. Persons in advanced stages of dementia differ in predictability of word choice and production strategy people in early stages only in predictability of production strategy.",

Protein side-chain packing (PSCP), the task of determining amino acid side-chain conformations, has important applications to protein structure prediction, refinement, and design. Many methods have been proposed to resolve this problem, but their accuracy is still unsatisfactory. To address this, we present AttnPacker, an end-to-end, SE(3)-equivariant deep graph transformer architecture for the direct prediction of side-chain coordinates. Unlike existing methods, AttnPacker directly incorporates backbone geometry to simultaneously compute all amino acid side-chain atom coordinates without delegating to a rotamer library, or performing expensive conformational search or sampling steps. Tested on the CASP13 and CASP14 native and non-native protein backbones, AttnPacker predicts side-chain conformations with RMSD significantly lower than the best side-chain packing methods (SCWRL4, FASPR, Rosetta Packer, and DLPacker), and achieves even greater improvements on surface residues. In addition to RMSD, our method also achieves top performance in side-chain dihedral prediction across both data sets.",

Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) requires models to answer factoid questions with no context given. The common way for this task is to train models on a large-scale annotated dataset to retrieve related documents and generate answers based on these documents. In this paper, we show that the ODQA architecture can be dramatically simpli\ufb01ed by treating Large Language Models (LLMs) as a knowledge corpus and propose a Self-Prompting framework for LLMs to perform ODQA so as to eliminate the need for training data and external knowledge corpus. Concretely, we \ufb01rstly generate multiple pseudo QA pairs with background passages and one-sentence explanations for these QAs by prompting LLMs step by step and then leverage the generated QA pairs for in-context learning. Experimental results show our method surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods by +8.8 EM averagely on three widely-used ODQA datasets, and even achieves comparable performance with several retrieval-augmented \ufb01ne-tuned models.",

Despite achieving state-of-the-art performance on many NLP tasks, the high energy cost and long inference delay prevent Transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs) from seeing broader adoption including for edge and mobile computing. Efficient NLP research aims to comprehensively consider computation, time and carbon emission for the entire life-cycle of NLP, including data preparation, model training and inference. In this survey, we focus on the inference stage and review the current state of model compression and acceleration for pretrained language models, including benchmarks, metrics and methodology.",

Abstract While pretrained language models (LMs) have driven impressive gains over morpho-syntactic and semantic tasks, their ability to model discourse and pragmatic phenomena is less clear. As a step towards a better understanding of their discourse modeling capabilities, we propose a sentence intrusion detection task. We examine the performance of a broad range of pretrained LMs on this detection task for English. Lacking a dataset for the task, we introduce INSteD, a novel intruder sentence detection dataset, containing 170,000+ documents constructed from English Wikipedia and CNN news articles. Our experiments show that pretrained LMs perform impressively in in-domain evaluation, but experience a substantial drop in the cross-domain setting, indicating limited generalization capacity. Further results over a novel linguistic probe dataset show that there is substantial room for improvement, especially in the cross- domain setting.",

        "abstract": "A systematic empirical analysis across six typologically diverse languages and five different lexical tasks indicates patterns and best practices that hold universally, but also point to prominent variations across languages and tasks. The success of large pretrained language models (LMs) such as BERT and RoBERTa has sparked interest in probing their representations, in order to unveil what types of knowledge they implicitly capture. While prior research focused on morphosyntactic, semantic, and world knowledge, it remains unclear to which extent LMs also derive lexical type-level knowledge from words in context. In this work, we present a systematic empirical analysis across six typologically diverse languages and five different lexical tasks, addressing the following questions: 1) How do different lexical knowledge extraction strategies (monolingual versus multilingual source LM, out-of-context versus in-context encoding, inclusion of special tokens, and layer-wise averaging) impact performance? How consistent are the observed effects across tasks and languages? 2) Is lexical knowledge stored in few parameters, or is it scattered throughout the network? 3) How do these representations fare against traditional static word vectors in lexical tasks? 4) Does the lexical information emerging from independently trained monolingual LMs display latent similarities? Our main results indicate patterns and best practices that hold universally, but also point to prominent variations across languages and tasks. Moreover, we validate the claim that lower Transformer layers carry more type-level lexical knowledge, but also show that this knowledge is distributed across multiple layers.",

        "abstract": "An innovative distributed approach for the detection of clone node attack is proposed, that is robust against smart attacker in mobile wireless sensor networks and has less communication overhead and false alarm probability and better performance compared to previously proposed approaches. Clone attack is considered as the most important security challenge of wireless sensor networks. In this paper, an innovative distributed approach for the detection of clone node attack is proposed, that is robust against smart attacker in mobile wireless sensor networks. Previously proposed approaches suffer disadvantages such as memory and communication overheads, probability of false alarm and high detection time, however, the detection approach proposed here takes advantage of introducing the observer position concept and hence achieves clone node detection in one cycle of protocol execution leading to less communication overheads. Performance of the proposed approach is analysed in terms of security and cost. To improve performance, using a discrete model and detection cost function stated as a convex optimisation problem and parameters optimised values are calculated. Finally, the simulation results show that proposed approach has less communication overhead and false alarm probability and better performance compared to previously proposed approaches.",

In order to realize comprehensive observation and research on the ocean, large-scale data integration needs to be carried out on the existing heterogeneous ocean observing systems. However, the content and format of ocean observation data sources are extremely complicated, which causes problems such as large amount of calculation, long time for matching and high error rate in the process of ocean observation element conversion. By using edge computing and improved KNN algorithm, we propose a new automatic matching method for ocean observation elements based on edge computing. According to the characteristics and advantages of the local, edge and cloud, the different processes of matching observation elements are executed. In order to solve the problem of large amount of computation and occupying much space, KNN algorithm is improved by grouping fast search (G-KNN) and weighted Euclidean distance (\u03c9-KNN). The prototype system was established by using the actual ocean observation data set to verify the method. The results show that this method can improve the execution efficiency by 2.67 times and the accuracy rate of 96%, which can further improve the efficiency while ensuring the accuracy of ocean observation element matching.",

        "abstract": "The novelty lies in that gated-dilated convolution is combined with multi-head self-attention to extract effective discriminative features, and learn their difference and connection from word form, parts of speech, and semantic categories. Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is to determine correct sense of ambiguous word based on its context. WSD is widely used in text classification, machine translation and information retrieval and so on. WSD accuracy is low because disambiguation features can not cover more language phenomenon and the discriminative ability of WSD model is not high. In order to improve accuracy of simplified Chinese WSD, a WSD model based on multi-head self-attention and gated-dilated convolutional neural network(AGDCNN) is proposed. Ambiguous word is viewed as the center and 4 adjacent lexical units are extracted successively toward the left and right side. Words, parts of speech, and semantic categories in 4 adjacent lexical units are vectorized and the vectorized results are input into gated-dilated convolutional neural network to get discriminative features. Then, multi-head self-attention is adopted to learn the difference and connection among discriminative features fully. Finally, classification weights are output from adaptive average pooling layer. Experiments are conducted on SemEval-2007: Task#5 and SemEval-2021: Task#2. Experimental results show that AGDCNN model has higher accuracy compared with other methods. Our goal is to improve the quality of simplified Chinese WSD as much as possible based on current linguistic resources and machine learning methods. The challenge we face is to extract effective discriminative features and design disambiguation model in high quality. Our novelty lies in that gated-dilated convolution is combined with multi-head self-attention to extract effective discriminative features, and learn their difference and connection from word form, parts of speech, and semantic categories.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning-based direct ASC at whole-body PET is feasible and potentially can be used to overcome the current limitations of CT-based approaches, benefiting patients who are sensitive to radiation from CT. Purpose\nTo demonstrate the feasibility of CT-less attenuation and scatter correction (ASC) in the image space using deep learning for whole-body PET, with a focus on the potential benefits and pitfalls.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nIn this retrospective study, 110 whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT studies acquired in 107 patients (mean age \u00b1 standard deviation, 58 years \u00b1 18; age range, 11-92 years; 72 females) from February 2016 through January 2018 were randomly collected. A total of 37.3% (41 of 110) of the studies showed metastases, with diverse FDG PET findings throughout the whole body. A U-Net-based network was developed for directly transforming noncorrected PET (PETNC) into attenuation- and scatter-corrected PET (PETASC). Deep learning-corrected PET (PETDL) images were quantitatively evaluated by using the standardized uptake value (SUV) of the normalized root mean square error, the peak signal-to-noise ratio, and the structural similarity index, in addition to a joint histogram for statistical analysis. Qualitative reviews by radiologists revealed the potential benefits and pitfalls of this correction method.\n\n\nResults\nThe normalized root mean square error (0.21 \u00b1 0.05 [mean SUV \u00b1 standard deviation]), mean peak signal-to-noise ratio (36.3 \u00b1 3.0), mean structural similarity index (0.98 \u00b1 0.01), and voxelwise correlation (97.62%) of PETDL demonstrated quantitatively high similarity with PETASC. Radiologist reviews revealed the overall quality of PETDL. The potential benefits of PETDL include a radiation dose reduction on follow-up scans and artifact removal in the regions with attenuation correction- and scatter correction-based artifacts. The pitfalls involve potential false-negative results due to blurring or missing lesions or false-positive results due to pseudo-low-uptake patterns.\n\n\nConclusion\nDeep learning-based direct ASC at whole-body PET is feasible and potentially can be used to overcome the current limitations of CT-based approaches, benefiting patients who are sensitive to radiation from CT.Supplemental material is available for this article.\u00a9\u2009RSNA, 2020.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a novel image dataset construction framework by employing multiple textual queries and formulate noisy textual queries removing and noisy images filtering as a multi-view and multi-instance learning problem separately. The availability of labeled image datasets has been shown critical for high-level image understanding, which continuously drives the progress of feature designing and models developing. However, constructing labeled image datasets is laborious and monotonous. To eliminate manual annotation, in this work, we propose a novel image dataset construction framework by employing multiple textual queries. We aim at collecting diverse and accurate images for given queries from the Web. Specifically, we formulate noisy textual queries removing and noisy images filtering as a multi-view and multi-instance learning problem separately. Our proposed approach not only improves the accuracy but also enhances the diversity of the selected images. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we construct an image dataset with 100 categories. The experiments show significant performance gains by using the generated data of our approach on several tasks, such as image classification, cross-dataset generalization, and object detection. The proposed method also consistently outperforms existing weakly supervised and web-supervised approaches.",

        "abstract": "This work believes that this work is the first multi-class model that uses a Transformer based architecture such as RoBERTa to analyze people\u2019s emotions and psychology and contributes to the public health system by automating some of the detection process and alerting relevant authorities about users that need immediate help. Given the current social distancing regulations across the world, social media has become the primary mode of communication for most people. This has isolated millions suffering from mental illnesses who are unable to receive assistance in person. They have increasingly turned to online platforms to express themselves and to look for guidance in dealing with their illnesses. Keeping this in mind, we propose a solution to classify mental illness posts on social media thereby enabling users to seek appropriate help. In this work, we classify five prominent kinds of mental illnesses- depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, ADHD and PTSD by analyzing unstructured user data on Reddit. In addition, we share a new high-quality dataset1 to drive research on this topic. The dataset consists of the title and post texts from 17159 posts and 13 subreddits each associated with one of the five mental illnesses listed above or a None class indicating the absence of any mental illness. Our model is trained on Reddit data but is easily extensible to other social media platforms as well as demonstrated in our results.We believe that our work is the first multi-class model that uses a Transformer based architecture such as RoBERTa to analyze people\u2019s emotions and psychology. We also demonstrate how we stress test our model using behavioral testing. Our dataset is publicly available and we encourage researchers to utilize this to advance research in this arena. We hope that this work contributes to the public health system by automating some of the detection process and alerting relevant authorities about users that need immediate help.",

        "abstract": "A systematic review of publications using deep learning approaches and neuroimaging data for diagnostic classification of AD found the best classification performance was obtained when multimodal neuroim imaging and fluid biomarkers were combined. Deep learning, a state-of-the-art machine learning approach, has shown outstanding performance over traditional machine learning in identifying intricate structures in complex high-dimensional data, especially in the domain of computer vision. The application of deep learning to early detection and automated classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently gained considerable attention, as rapid progress in neuroimaging techniques has generated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data. A systematic review of publications using deep learning approaches and neuroimaging data for diagnostic classification of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January 2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches. The combination of traditional machine learning for classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8% for AD classification and 83.7% for prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data without pre-processing for feature selection have yielded accuracies of up to 96.0% for AD classification and 84.2% for MCI conversion prediction. The best classification performance was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers were combined. Deep learning approaches continue to improve in performance and appear to hold promise for diagnostic classification of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. AD research that uses deep learning is still evolving, improving performance by incorporating additional hybrid data types, such as\u2014omics data, increasing transparency with explainable approaches that add knowledge of specific disease-related features and mechanisms.",

In this paper we address the automatic summarization task. Recent research works on extractive-summary generation employ some heuristics, but few works indicate how to select the relevant features. We will present a summarization procedure based on the application of trainable Machine Learning algorithms which employs a set of features extracted directly from the original text. These features are of two kinds: statistical - based on the frequency of some elements in the text; and linguistic - extracted from a simplified argumentative structure of the text. We also present some computational results obtained with the application of our summarizer to some well known text databases, and we compare these results to some baseline summarization procedures.",

Received: 29 May 2021 Accepted: 1 September 2021 In the identification of which stages Alzheimer\u2019s patients are in, the application of the medical imaging technology helps doctors give more accurate qualitative diagnoses. However, the existing research results are not effective enough in the acquisition of valuable information from medical images, nor can they make full use of other modal images that highlight different feature information. To this end, this paper studies the application of deep learning and brain images in the diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s patients. First, the image preprocessing operations and the brain image registration process were explained in detail. Then, the image block generation process was given, and the degrees of membership to white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid were calculated, and the brain images were also preliminarily classified. Finally, a complete auxiliary diagnosis process for Alzheimer\u2019s disease based on deep learning was provided, an improved sparse noise reduction autoencoder network was constructed, and the brain image recognition and classification based on deep learning were completed. The experimental results verified the effectiveness of the constructed model.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent Credit Scoring presents a business-oriented process for the development and implementation of risk prediction scorecards. The credit scorecard is a powerful tool for measuring the risk of individual borrowers, gauging overall risk exposure and developing analytically driven, risk-adjusted strategies for existing customers. In the past 10 years, hundreds of banks worldwide have brought the process of developing credit scoring models in-house, while \u2018credit scores' have become a frequent topic of conversation in many countries where bureau scores are used broadly. In the United States, the \u2018FICO' and \u2018Vantage' scores continue to be discussed by borrowers hoping to get a better deal from the banks. While knowledge of the statistical processes around building credit scorecards is common, the business context and intelligence that allows you to build better, more robust, and ultimately more intelligent, scorecards is not. As the follow-up to Credit Risk Scorecards, this updated second edition includes new detailed examples, new real-world stories, new diagrams, deeper discussion on topics including WOE curves, the latest trends that expand scorecard functionality and new indepth analyses in every chapter. Expanded coverage includes new chapters on defining infrastructure for in-house credit scoring, validation, governance, and Big Data.",

Semantic deficit is a symptom of language impairment in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). We present a generalizable method for automatic generation of information content units (ICUs) for a picture used in a standard clinical task, achieving high recall, 96.8%, of human-supplied ICUs. We use the automatically generated topic model to extract semantic features, and train a random forest classifier to achieve an F-score of 0.74 in binary classification of controls versus people with AD using a set of only 12 features. This is comparable to results (0.72 F-score) with a set of 85 manual features. Adding semantic information to a set of standard lexicosyntactic and acoustic features improves F-score to 0.80.

Building on the success of the ADReSS Challenge at Interspeech 2020, which attracted the participation of 34 teams from across the world, the ADReSSo Challenge targets three difficult automatic prediction problems of societal and medical relevance, namely: detection of Alzheimer's Dementia, inference of cognitive testing scores, and prediction of cognitive decline. This paper presents these prediction tasks in detail, describes the datasets used, and reports the results of the baseline classification and regression models we developed for each task. A combination of acoustic and linguistic features extracted directly from audio recordings, without human intervention, yielded a baseline accuracy of 78.87% for the AD classification task, an MMSE prediction root mean squared (RMSE) error of 5.28, and 68.75% accuracy for the cognitive decline prediction task.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to provide an effective solution to recognize the various types of potato diseases by presenting a deep learning approach called EfficientPNet, and introduces an end-to-end training-oriented approach by using the EfficientNet-V2 network to recognize various potato leaf disorders. The potato plant is amongst the most significant vegetable crops farmed worldwide. The output of potato crop production is significantly reduced by various leaf diseases, which poses a danger to the world\u2019s agricultural production in terms of both volume and quality. The two most destructive foliar infections for potato plants are early and late blight triggered by Alternaria solani and Phytophthora infestans. In actuality, farm owners predict these problems by focusing primarily on the alteration in the color of the potato leaves, which is typically problematic owing to uncertainty and significant time commitment. In these circumstances, it is vital to develop computer-aided techniques that automatically identify these disorders quickly and reliably, even in their early stages. This paper aims to provide an effective solution to recognize the various types of potato diseases by presenting a deep learning (DL) approach called EfficientPNet. More specifically, we introduce an end-to-end training-oriented approach by using the EfficientNet-V2 network to recognize various potato leaf disorders. A spatial-channel attention method is introduced to concentrate on the damaged areas and enhance the approach\u2019s recognition ability to effectively identify numerous infections. To address the problem of class-imbalanced samples and to improve network generalization ability, the EANet model is tuned using transfer learning, and dense layers are added at the end of the model structure to enhance the feature selection power of the model. The model is tested on an open and challenging dataset called PlantVillage, containing images taken in diverse and complicated background conditions, including various lightning conditions and the different color changes in leaves. The model obtains an accuracy of 98.12% on the task of classifying various potato plant leaf diseases such as late blight, early blight, and healthy leaves in 10,800 images. We have confirmed through the performed experiments that our approach is effective for potato plant leaf disease classification and can robustly tackle distorted samples. Hence, farmers can save money and harvest by using the EfficientPNet tool.",

        "abstract": "The relation between SVF results and MMSE/CDR-SOB scores is investigated and it is concluded that the approach has potential to serve as a cheap dementia screening, possibly even in non-clinical settings. The standard dementia screening tool Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the standard dementia staging tool Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) are prominent methods for answering questions whether a person might have dementia and about the dementia severity respectively. These methods are time consuming and require well-educated personnel to administer. Conversely, cognitive tests, such as the Semantic Verbal Fluency (SVF), demand little time. With this as a starting point, we investigate the relation between SVF results and MMSE/CDR-SOB scores. We use regression models to predict scores based on persons' SVF performance. Over a set of 179 patients with different degree of dementia, we achieve a mean absolute error of of 2.2 for MMSE (range 0\u201330) and 1.7 for CDR-SOB (range 0\u201318). True and predicted scores agree with a Cohen's \u03ba of 0.76 for MMSE and 0.52 for CDR-SOB. We conclude that our approach has potential to serve as a cheap dementia screening, possibly even in non-clinical settings.",

A deep neural network based architecture was constructed to predict amino acid side chain conformation with unprecedented accuracy. Amino acid side chain conformation prediction is essential for protein homology modeling and protein design. Current widely-adopted methods use physics-based energy functions to evaluate side chain conformation. Here, using a deep neural network architecture without physics-based assumptions, we have demonstrated that side chain conformation prediction accuracy can be improved by more than 25%, especially for aromatic residues compared with current standard methods. More strikingly, the prediction method presented here is robust enough to identify individual conformational outliers from high resolution structures in a protein data bank without providing its structural factors. We envisage that our amino acid side chain predictor could be used as a quality check step for future protein structure model validation and many other potential applications such as side chain assignment in Cryo-electron microscopy, crystallography model auto-building, protein folding and small molecule ligand docking.",

        "abstract": "This study empirically investigates the consequences of repeating pre-training data, revealing that the model is susceptible to overfitting, leading to multi-epoch degradation, and discovers that leveraging mixture-of-experts (MoE) enables cost-effective and efficient hyper-parameter tuning for computationally intensive dense LLMs with comparable trainable parameters. Recent research has highlighted the importance of dataset size in scaling language models. However, large language models (LLMs) are notoriously token-hungry during pre-training, and high-quality text data on the web is approaching its scaling limit for LLMs. To further enhance LLMs, a straightforward approach is to repeat the pre-training data for additional epochs. In this study, we empirically investigate three key aspects under this approach. First, we explore the consequences of repeating pre-training data, revealing that the model is susceptible to overfitting, leading to multi-epoch degradation. Second, we examine the key factors contributing to multi-epoch degradation, finding that significant factors include dataset size, model parameters, and training objectives, while less influential factors consist of dataset quality and model FLOPs. Finally, we explore whether widely used regularization can alleviate multi-epoch degradation. Most regularization techniques do not yield significant improvements, except for dropout, which demonstrates remarkable effectiveness but requires careful tuning when scaling up the model size. Additionally, we discover that leveraging mixture-of-experts (MoE) enables cost-effective and efficient hyper-parameter tuning for computationally intensive dense LLMs with comparable trainable parameters, potentially impacting efficient LLM development on a broader scale.",

        "abstract": "GOBO is presented, a model quantization technique that compresses the vast majority (typically 99.9%) of the 32-bit floating-point parameters of state-of-the-art BERT models and their variants to 3 bits while maintaining their accuracy. Attention-based models have demonstrated remarkable success in various natural language understanding tasks. However, efficient execution remains a challenge for these models which are memory-bound due to their massive number of parameters. We present GOBO, a model quantization technique that compresses the vast majority (typically 99.9%) of the 32-bit floating-point parameters of state-of-the-art BERT models and their variants to 3 bits while maintaining their accuracy. Unlike other quantization methods, GOBO does not require fine-tuning nor retraining to compensate for the quantization error. We present two practical hardware applications of GOBO. In the first GOBO reduces memory storage and traffic and as a result inference latency and energy consumption. This GOBO memory compression mechanism is plug-in compatible with many architectures; we demonstrate it with the TPU, Eyeriss, and an architecture using Tensor Cores-like units. Second, we present a co-designed hardware architecture that also reduces computation. Uniquely, the GOBO architecture maintains most of the weights in 3b even during computation, a property that: (i) makes the processing elements area efficient, allowing us to pack more compute power per unit area, (ii) replaces most multiply-accumulations with additions, and (iii) reduces the off-chip traffic by amplifying on-chip memory capacity.",

        "abstract": "A new test, dubbed TALES, is created with an exclusive focus on Portuguese lexical-semantic relations, acquired from lexical resources, and suggests that word embeddings may be a useful source of information for enriching those resources, something the authors also discuss. Models of word embeddings are often assessed when solving syntactic and semantic analogies. Among the latter, we are interested in relations that one would find in lexical-semantic knowledge bases like WordNet, also covered by some analogy test sets for English. Briefly, this paper aims to study how well pretrained Portuguese word embeddings capture such relations. For this purpose, we created a new test, dubbed TALES, with an exclusive focus on Portuguese lexical-semantic relations, acquired from lexical resources. With TALES, we analyse the performance of methods previously used for solving analogies, on different models of Portuguese word embeddings. Accuracies were clearly below the state of the art in analogies of other kinds, which shows that TALES is a challenging test, mainly due to the nature of lexical-semantic relations, i.e., there are many instances sharing the same argument, thus allowing for several correct answers, sometimes too many to be all included in the dataset. We further inspect the results of the best performing combination of method and model to find that some acceptable answers had been considered incorrect. This was mainly due to the lack of coverage by the source lexical resources and suggests that word embeddings may be a useful source of information for enriching those resources, something we also discuss.",

As the \u2018Industry 4.0\u2019 has been proposed, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used in more and more fields, and the higher demand for data acquisition efficiency. Unfortunately, the format, type, and access methods of data sources in different areas are diverse, making low efficiency of data acquisition. To address this issue, based on the data acquisition middleware of IoT (DAQ-Middleware), a novel High-speed Data Acquisition Algorithm of IoT (HDAA) is proposed. The algorithm includes parallel data acquisition algorithm and acquisition efficiency optimization heuristic method. According to the characteristics of different data sources and data interfaces, the mapping relationship is established between data sources and data interfaces, which improves the data acquisition efficiency of IoT. In the practical application and simulation environment, the data acquisition efficiency of HDAA is analyzed and compared with other algorithms. The results show that HDAA greatly improves the efficiency of data acquisition. In particular, the advantage of the algorithm is more obvious in the case of more data sources and less data interfaces.",

        "abstract": "Two deep-learning-based models for supervised WSD are proposed: a model based on bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network, and an attention modelBased on self-attention architecture that performs even better than the existing state-of-the-art models on the MSH WSD dataset. In recent years, deep learning methods have been applied to many natural language processing tasks to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, in the biomedical domain, they have not out-performed supervised word sense disambiguation (WSD) methods based on support vector machines or random forests, possibly due to inherent similarities of medical word senses. In this paper, we propose two deep-learning-based models for supervised WSD: a model based on bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network, and an attention model based on self-attention architecture. Our result shows that the BiLSTM neural network model with a suitable upper layer structure performs even better than the existing state-of-the-art models on the MSH WSD dataset, while our attention model was 3 or 4 times faster than our BiLSTM model with good accuracy. In addition, we trained \u201cuniversal\u201d models in order to disambiguate all ambiguous words together. That is, we concatenate the embedding of the target ambiguous word to the max-pooled vector in the universal models, acting as a \u201chint\u201d. The result shows that our universal BiLSTM neural network model yielded about 90 percent accuracy. Deep contextual models based on sequential information processing methods are able to capture the relative contextual information from pre-trained input word embeddings, in order to provide state-of-the-art results for supervised biomedical WSD tasks.",

        "abstract": "The current generation of total-body positron emission tomography (PET) scanners offer significant sensitivity increase with an extended axial imaging extent. With the large volume of lutetium-based scintillation crystals that are used as detector elements in these scanners, there is an increased flux of background radiation originating from 176Lu decay in the crystals and higher sensitivity for detecting it. Combined with the ability of scanning the entire body in a single bed position, this allows more effective utilization of the lutetium background as a transmission source for estimating 511 keV attenuation coefficients. In this study, utilization of the lutetium background radiation for attenuation correction in total-body PET was studied using Monte Carlo simulations of a 3D whole-body XCAT phantom in the uEXPLORER PET scanner, with particular focus on ultralow-dose PET scans that are now made possible with these scanners. Effects of an increased acceptance angle, reduced scan durations, and Compton scattering on PET quantification were studied. Furthermore, quantification accuracy of lutetium-based attenuation correction was compared for a 20-min scan of the whole body on the uEXPLORER, a one-meter-long, and a conventional 24-cm-long scanner. Quantification and lesion contrast were minimally affected in both long axial field-of-view scanners and in a whole-body 20-min scan, the mean bias in all analyzed organs of interest were within a \u00b110% range compared to ground-truth activity maps. Quantification was affected in certain organs, when scan duration was reduced to 5 min or a reduced acceptance angle of 17\u00b0 was used. Analysis of the Compton scattered events suggests that implementing a scatter correction method for the transmission data will be required, and increasing the energy threshold from 250 keV to 290 keV can reduce the computational costs and data rates, with negligible effects on PET quantification. Finally, the current results can serve as groundwork for transferring lutetium-based attenuation correction into research and clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a data-driven meta-set based approach to deal with noisy web images for fine-grained recognition, which can alleviate the harmful effects caused by out-of-distribution noise and properly exploit the in-dist distribution noisy samples for training. Constructing fine-grained image datasets typically requires domain-specific expert knowledge, which is not always available for crowd-sourcing platform annotators. Accordingly, learning directly from web images becomes an alternative method for fine-grained visual recognition. However, label noise in the web training set can severely degrade the model performance. To this end, we propose a data-driven meta-set based approach to deal with noisy web images for fine-grained recognition. Specifically, guided by a small amount of clean meta-set, we train a selection net in a meta-learning manner to distinguish in- and out-of-distribution noisy images. To further boost the robustness of model, we also learn a labeling net to correct the labels of in-distribution noisy data. In this way, our proposed method can alleviate the harmful effects caused by out-of-distribution noise and properly exploit the in-distribution noisy samples for training. Extensive experiments on three commonly used fine-grained datasets demonstrate that our approach is much superior to state-of-the-art noise-robust methods.",

        "abstract": ". Given the current social distance restrictions across the world, most individuals now use social media as their major medium of communication. Millions of people su\ufb00ering from mental diseases have been isolated due to this, and they are unable to get help in person. They have become more reliant on online venues to express themselves and seek advice on dealing with their mental disorders. According to the World health organization (WHO), approximately 450 million people are a\ufb00ected. Mental illnesses, such as depression, anxiety, etc., are im-mensely common and have a\ufb00ected an individual\u2019s physical health. Re-cently Arti\ufb01cial Intelligence (AI) methods have been presented to help mental health providers, including psychiatrists and psychologists, in decision-making based on patients\u2019 authentic information (e.g., medical records, behavioral data, social media utilization, etc.). AI innova-tions have demonstrated predominant execution in numerous real-world applications broadening from computer vision to healthcare. This study analyzes unstructured user data on the Reddit platform and classi\ufb01es \ufb01ve common mental illnesses: depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, ADHD, and PTSD. We trained traditional machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning multi-class models to detect mental disorders of individuals. This e\ufb00ort will bene\ufb01t the public health system by automating the detection process and informing appropriate authorities about people who require emergency assistance.",

        "abstract": "The hypothesis is that an unsupervised algorithm can help for clustering similar ideas (sentences) and, for composing the summary, the most representative sentence is selected from each cluster. The main problem for generating an extractive automatic text summary is to detect the most relevant information in the source document. Although, some approaches claim being domain and language independent, they use high dependence knowledge like key-phrases or golden samples for machine-learning approaches. In this work, we propose a language- and domain-independent automatic text summarization approach by sentence extraction using an unsupervised learning algorithm. Our hypothesis is that an unsupervised algorithm can help for clustering similar ideas (sentences). Then, for composing the summary, the most representative sentence is selected from each cluster. Several experiments in the standard DUC-2002 collection show that the proposed method obtains more favorable results than other approaches.",

        "abstract": "This experiment suggests that the shift and scale invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning classification represents the most powerful method of distinguishing clinical data from healthy data in fMRI. Over the past decade, machine learning techniques and in particular predictive modeling and pattern recognition in biomedical sciences, from drug delivery systems to medical imaging, have become one of the most important methods of assisting researchers in gaining a deeper understanding of issues in their entirety and solving complex medical problems. Deep learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm in classification that extracts low- to high-level features. In this paper, we employ a convolutional neural network to distinguish an Alzheimers brain from a normal, healthy brain. The importance of classifying this type of medical data lies in its potential to develop a predictive model or system in order to recognize the symptoms of Alzheimers disease when compared with normal subjects and to estimate the stages of the disease. Classification of clinical data for medical conditions such as Alzheimers disease has always been challenging, and the most problematic aspect has always been selecting the strongest discriminative features. Using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the famous architecture LeNet-5, we successfully classified functional MRI data of Alzheimers subjects from normal controls, where the accuracy of testing data reached 96.85%. This experiment suggests that the shift and scale invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning classification represents the most powerful method of distinguishing clinical data from healthy data in fMRI. This approach also allows for expansion of the methodology to predict more complicated systems.",

        "abstract": "The Basel II Accord pointed out benefits of credit risk management through internal models to estimate Probability of Default (PD). Banks use default predictions to estimate the loan applicants\u2019 PD. However, in practice, PD is not useful and banks applied credit scorecards for their decision making process. Also the competitive pressures in lending industry forced banks to use profit scorecards, which show the profitability of customers. Applying these scorecards together makes the loan decision making process for banks more confusing. This paper has an obvious and clean solution for facilitating the confusion of loan decision making process by combining the credit and profit scorecards through introducing a matrix sequential hybrid credit scorecard. The applicability of the introduced matrix sequential hybrid scorecard results are shown using data from an Iranian bank.",

        "abstract": "This work presents an approach to automatically classify Alzheimer\u2019s disease using a set of pragmatic features extracted from a discourse production task, and says pragmatic features are able to provide promising results distinguishing individuals with Alzheimer's disease, comparable to solutions based on other types of linguistic features. Language impairment in Alzheimer\u2019s disease is characterized by a decline in the semantic and pragmatic levels of language processing that manifests since the early stages of the disease. While semantic de\ufb01cits have been widely investigated using linguistic features, pragmatic de\ufb01cits are still mostly un-explored. In this work, we present an approach to automatically classify Alzheimer\u2019s disease using a set of pragmatic features extracted from a discourse production task. Following the clinical practice, we consider an image representing a closed domain as a discourse\u2019s elicitation form. Then, we model the elicited speech as a graph that encodes a hierarchy of topics. To do so, the proposed method relies on the integration of various NLP techniques: syntactic parsing for sentence segmentation into clauses, coreference resolution for capturing dependencies among clauses, and word embeddings for identifying semantic relations among topics. According to the experimental results, pragmatic features are able to provide promising results distinguishing individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, comparable to solutions based on other types of linguistic features.",

This paper addresses the Interspeech Alzheimer\u2019s Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech only (ADReSSo) challenge 2021. The objective of our study is to propose the approach to a three task automated screening that will aid in distinguishing between healthy individuals and subjects with dementia. The \ufb01rst task is to differentiate between speech recordings from individuals with dementia. The second task requires participants to estimate the Mini-Mental State Exam-ination (MMSE) score based on an individual\u2019s speech. The third task requires participants to leverage speech recordings to identify whether individuals have suffered from cognitive decline. Here, we propose a system based on functionals of deep textual embeddings with special preprocessing steps integrating the effect of silence segments. We report that the developed system outperforms the challenge baseline for all three tasks. For Task 1, we achieve an accuracy of 84 . 51% compared to the baseline of 77 . 46% , for Task 2, we achieve a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 4 . 35 compared to the baseline of 5 . 28 , and for Task 3, we achieve an average-f1score of 73 . 80% compared to the baseline of 66 . 67% . These results are a testament of the effectiveness of our proposed system.",

        "abstract": "It is illustrated that the dynamic networks computed under the proposed method are able to better predict psychological resilience among trauma exposed individuals compared to existing dynamic and stationary connectivity approaches, which highlights its potential as a neuroimaging biomarker. Recently, the potential of dynamic brain networks as a neuroimaging biomarkers for mental illnesses is being increasingly recognized. However, there are several unmet challenges in developing such biomarkers, including the need for methods to model rapidly changing network states. In one of the first such efforts, we develop a novel approach for computing dynamic brain functional connectivity (FC), that is guided by brain structural connectivity (SC) computed from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. The proposed approach involving dynamic Gaussian graphical models decomposes the time course into non-overlapping state phases determined by change points, each having a distinct network. We develop an optimization algorithm to implement the method such that the estimation of both the change points and the state-phase specific networks are fully data driven and unsupervised, and guided by SC information. The approach is scalable to large dimensions and extensive simulations illustrate its clear advantages over existing methods in terms of network estimation accuracy and detecting dynamic network changes. An application of the method to a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) study reveals important dynamic resting state connections in regions of the brain previously implicated in PTSD. We also illustrate that the dynamic networks computed under the proposed method are able to better predict psychological resilience among trauma exposed individuals compared to existing dynamic and stationary connectivity approaches, which highlights its potential as a neuroimaging biomarker.",

        "title": "A novel framework for potato leaf disease detection using an efficient deep learning model",
        "abstract": "The proposed algorithm is a novel and first technique to address and report the successful implementation for the detection and classification of four diseases in potato leaves and is more consistent and proficient to detect and classify potato leaves diseases than existing models. Abstract Potato disease management plays a valuable role in the agriculture field as it might cause a significant loss in crops production. Therefore, timely recognition and classification of potato leaves diseases are necessary to minimize the loss, however, it is time taking task and requires human efforts. Thus, an accurate automated technique for timely detection and classification is needed to cope with the aforementioned challenges.There exist techniques grounded on machine learning and deep learning procedures that use the existing dataset i.e., \u2018The Plant Village Dataset\u2019 and perform classification into only two classes in potato leaves. Therefore, this article proposes a technique based on an improved deep learning algorithm that uses the potato leaf visual features to classify them into five classes i.e., Potato Late Blight (PLB), Potato Early Blight (PEB), Potato Leaf Roll (PLR), Potato Verticillium_wilt (PVw) and Potato Healthy (PH) class. The propose model is trained on the existing dataset i.e., \u201cThe Plant Village\u201d that comprises of images having two ailments such as Early Blight (EB) and Late Blight (LB), and a Healthy class for potato leaves. Additionally, we have gathered the data for classes i.e., Potato Leaf Roll (PLR), Potato Verticillium_wilt (PVw) and Potato Healthy (PH) manually. A pre-trained Efficient DenseNet model has been employed utilizing an extra transition layer in DenseNet-201 to classify the potato leave diseases efficiently. Moreover, the usage of the reweighted cross-entropy loss function makes our proposed algorithm more robust as the training data is highly imbalanced. The dense connections with regularization power help to minimize the overfitting during the training of small training sets of potato leaves samples. The proposed algorithm is a novel and first technique to address and report the successful implementation for the detection and classification of four diseases in potato leaves. The algorithm\u2019s performance was evaluated on the testing set and gave an accuracy of 97.2%. Various experiments have been performed to confirm that our proposed algorithm is more consistent and proficient to detect and classify potato leaves diseases than existing models.",

        "abstract": "The results indicate SVF as a prime candidate for inclusion into an automated telephone-screening system for dementia frontline screening and global risk assessment, based on concise telephone-sampled speech, ASR and machine learning classification. Dementia has a large economic impact on our society as cost-effective population-wide screening for early signs of dementia is still an unsolved medical supply resource problem. A solution should be fast, require a minimum of external material, and automatically indicate potential persons at risk of cognitive decline. Despite encouraging results, leveraging pervasive sensing technologies for automatic dementia screening, there are still two main issues: significant hardware costs or installation efforts and the challenge of effective pattern recognition. Conversely, automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech analysis have reached sufficient maturity and allow for low-tech remote telephone-based screening scenarios. Therefore, we examine the technologic feasibility of automatically assessing a neuropsychological test---Semantic Verbal Fluency (SVF)--via a telephone-based solution. We investigate its suitability for inclusion into an automated dementia frontline screening and global risk assessment, based on concise telephone-sampled speech, ASR and machine learning classification. Results are encouraging showing an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85. We observe a relatively low word error rate of 33% despite phone-quality speech samples and a mean age of 77 years of the participants. The automated classification pipeline performs equally well compared to the classifier trained on manual transcriptions of the same speech data. Our results indicate SVF as a prime candidate for inclusion into an automated telephone-screening system.",

        "abstract": "This review discusses various deep learning approaches used to predict protein structure and future achievements and challenges, and aims to help provide perspectives on problems in biochemistry that can take advantage of the deep learning approach. Proteins are macromolecules composed of 20 types of amino acids in a specific order. Understanding how proteins fold is vital because its 3-dimensional structure determines the function of a protein. Prediction of protein structure based on amino acid strands and evolutionary information becomes the basis for other studies such as predicting the function, property or behaviour of a protein and modifying or designing new proteins to perform certain desired functions. Machine learning advances, particularly deep learning, are igniting a paradigm shift in scientific study. In this review, we summarize recent work in applying deep learning techniques to tackle problems in protein structural prediction. We discuss various deep learning approaches used to predict protein structure and future achievements and challenges. This review is expected to help provide perspectives on problems in biochemistry that can take advantage of the deep learning approach. Some of the unanswered challenges with current computational approaches are predicting the location and precision orientation of protein side chains, predicting protein interactions with DNA, RNA and other small molecules and predicting the structure of protein complexes.",

        "abstract": "It is demonstrated that large learning rate and small batch size do not confer any implicit bias advantages in online learning, and suggests that SGD in the online regime can be construed as taking noisy steps along the \"golden path\" of the noiseless gradient flow algorithm. The success of SGD in deep learning has been ascribed by prior works to the implicit bias induced by high learning rate or small batch size (\"SGD noise\"). While prior works that focused on offline learning (i.e., multiple-epoch training), we study the impact of SGD noise on online (i.e., single epoch) learning. Through an extensive empirical analysis of image and language data, we demonstrate that large learning rate and small batch size do not confer any implicit bias advantages in online learning. In contrast to offline learning, the benefits of SGD noise in online learning are strictly computational, facilitating larger or more cost-effective gradient steps. Our work suggests that SGD in the online regime can be construed as taking noisy steps along the\"golden path\"of the noiseless gradient flow algorithm. We provide evidence to support this hypothesis by conducting experiments that reduce SGD noise during training and by measuring the pointwise functional distance between models trained with varying SGD noise levels, but at equivalent loss values. Our findings challenge the prevailing understanding of SGD and offer novel insights into its role in online learning.",

        "abstract": "EdgeBERT is presented, an in-depth and principled algorithm and hardware design methodology to achieve minimal latency and energy consumption on multi-task NLP inference and enables fully on-chip inference acceleration of NLP workloads with 5.2x and 157x lower energy than that of an un-optimized accelerator and CUDA adaptations on an Nvidia Jetson Tegra X2 mobile GPU, respectively. Transformer-based language models such as BERT provide significant accuracy improvement to a multitude of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their hefty computational and memory demands make them challenging to deploy to resource-constrained edge platforms with strict latency requirements. We present EdgeBERT an in-depth and principled algorithm and hardware design methodology to achieve minimal latency and energy consumption on multi-task NLP inference. Compared to the ALBERT baseline, we achieve up to 2.4x and 13.4x inference latency and memory savings, respectively, with less than 1%-pt drop in accuracy on several GLUE benchmarks by employing a calibrated combination of 1) entropy-based early stopping, 2) adaptive attention span, 3) movement and magnitude pruning, and 4) floating-point quantization. Furthermore, in order to maximize the benefits of these algorithms in always-on and intermediate edge computing settings, we specialize a scalable hardware architecture wherein floating-point bit encodings of the shareable multi-task embedding parameters are stored in high-density non-volatile memory. Altogether, EdgeBERT enables fully on-chip inference acceleration of NLP workloads with 5.2x, and 157x lower energy than that of an un-optimized accelerator and CUDA adaptations on an Nvidia Jetson Tegra X2 mobile GPU, respectively.",

        "abstract": "A novel DRL based dialogue policy optimisation method, A2CER and its effectiveness for a task-oriented SDS in the Indic language and it is shown to beat the current state-of-the-art deep learning methods for SDS. Dialogue policy is a crucial component in task-oriented Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDSs). As a decision function, it takes the current dialogue state as input and generates appropriate system\u2019s response. In this paper, we explore the reinforcement learning approaches to solve this problem in an Indic language scenario. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been used to optimise the dialogue policy. However, many DRL approaches are not sample-efficient. Hence, particular attention is given to actor-critic methods based on off-policy reinforcement learning that utilise the Experience Replay (ER) technique for reducing the bias and variance to achieve high sample efficiency. ER based actor-critic methods, such as Advantage Actor-Critic Experience Replay (A2CER) are proven to deliver competitive results in gaming environments that are fully observable and have a very small action-set. While, in SDSs, the states are not fully observable and often have to deal with the large action space. Describing the limitations of traditional methods, i.e., value-based and policy-based methods, such as high variance, low sample-efficiency, and often converging to local optima, we firstly explore the use of A2CER in dialogue policy learning. It is shown to beat the current state-of-the-art deep learning methods for SDS. Secondly, to handle the issues of early-stage performance, we utilise a demonstration corpus to pre-train the models prior to on-line policy learning. We thus experiment with the A2CER on a larger action space and find it significantly faster than the current state-of-the-art. Combining both approaches, we present a novel DRL based dialogue policy optimisation method, A2CER and its effectiveness for a task-oriented SDS in the Indic language.",

        "abstract": "An optimal algorithm for FIFO tasks in the offline case is provided, and later the r-FIFO architecture is synthesized on the FPGA board using ZYBO (zynq- 7000) and implemented in SCL 180\u00a0nm CMOS ASIC technology. To enhance the utilization efficiency of Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical system technologies, more collaboration in data transmission is recommended. These applications receive data from multiple sensors; hence, addition of efficient data acquisition system becomes mandatory. Past research works report use of data sharing among the tasks; however, this is only possible as long as the data meets the time-sensitive requirements of the tasks. To have an efficient communication between the different nodes of the IoT applications, this research work proposes use of reconfigurable first-in, first-out (r-FIFO) design to acquire data. This would not only reduce total sensing time but also the energy consumption, which is a conspicuous concernment in IoT systems for the offline scenarios. This paper first provides an optimal algorithm for FIFO tasks in the offline case, and later the r-FIFO architecture is synthesized on the FPGA board using ZYBO (zynq- 7000). Further, the design is being implemented in SCL 180\u00a0nm CMOS ASIC technology. Performance measurement is performed by evaluating the frequency, total power, and the energy per bit of the design.",

Biomedical words have many semantics. Biomedical word sense disambiguation (WSD) is an important research issue in biomedicine field. Biomedical WSD refers to the process of determining meanings of ambiguous word according to its context. It is widely applied to process, translate and retrieve biomedical texts now. In order to improve WSD accuracy in biomedicine, this paper proposes a new WSD method based on graph attention neural network (GAT). Words, parts of speech, and semantic categories in context of ambiguous word are used as disambiguation features. Disambiguation features and the sentence are used as nodes to construct WSD graph. GAT is used to extract discriminative features, and softmax function is applied to determine semantic category of biomedical ambiguous word. MSH dataset is used to optimize GAT-based WSD classifier and test its accuracy. Experiments show that average accuracy of the proposed method is improved. At the same time, majority voting strategy is adopted to optimize GAT-based WSD classifier further.",

        "abstract": "Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are established medical imaging modalities that have been implemented for decades, but improvements in detector design and camera electronics are needed for advancement of both imaging technologies. Detectors are arguably the most important aspect of the systems. Similar to SPECT, PET typically relies on indirect conversion of gamma radiation via scintillators coupled with photosensors used to convert optical photons produced by the scintillator into an electrical signal. PET detectors are defined by their energy resolution, timing resolution, and spatial resolution, all of which affect and determine the image quality. Improvements in energy resolution have been shown by increasing the brightness of the scintillator utilizing materials like cerium bromide (CeBr3) or switching to a direct conversion detector, such as cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) or thallium bromide (TlBr). Timing resolution for PET is a focal point of the current research. Improving the timing resolution improves the signal-to-noise of the PET system and is integral to the implementation of time-of-flight PET. By utilizing novel configurations, such as side readouts on scintillators, timing resolution has been improved dramatically. Similarly, metascintillators, which use complex combinations for the scintillator material, have also shown improvements to the timing resolution. Additional research has focused on using Cherenkov light emission in scintillators to further improve the timing resolution. Other research is focused on using convolutional neural networks and other signal processing to enhance timing resolution. Lastly, aside from acollinearity and positron range, spatial resolution is impacted by the PET detector, therefore improving the intrinsic spatial resolution of the detector will allow for smaller features to be imaged. One method for improving the spatial resolution is to use unique configurations with layered scintillators. Additionally, monolithic scintillators have also been shown to have reduced spatial resolution. The future for both SPECT and PET image system advancement will depend on continued development of the detectors via many different pathways including materials, signal processing, physics, and novel configurations. In this review article, we will discuss challenges and emerging technologies for state-of-the-art radiation detectors utilized in PET and SPECT.",

        "abstract": "A novel method to discard irrelevant noisy data from web data while keeping valid data for fine-grained classification is proposed and the effectiveness of the combination of sample selection and semi-supervised training strategy is proved. For fine-grained classification, it is extremely difficult and costly to acquire the annotated data. Hence, some studies propose to use web data for fine-grained classification. However, the web data contains tremendous noisy labels, which can affect the classification results. Although many previous studies propose to discard noisy data via sample selection, they also discard some valid data. The valid data denotes hard or mislabeled samples that can enhance the robustness of the model. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel method to discard irrelevant noisy data from web data while keeping valid data for fine-grained classification. Specifically, we divide the web data into clean and noisy samples and then distinguish the noisy samples into open-set and close-set noises. Finally, the model is constructed in a semi-supervised manner, where the clean samples are used as the labeled set, and the close-set noises are used as the unlabeled set. Extensive experiments verify that our method can improve the classification performance by an average of 1.89% on three fine-grained benchmark datasets compared with the current methods. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the combination of sample selection and semi-supervised training strategy.",

Psychological studies have shown that our state of mind can manifest itself in the linguistic features we use to communicate. People have increasingly turned to online platforms to express themselves and seek help with their conditions. Deep learning methods have been commonly used to identify and analyze mental health conditions from various sources of information, including social media. Still, they face challenges, including a lack of reliability and overconfidence in predictions resulting in the poor calibration of the models. To solve these issues, We propose UATTA-EB: Uncertainty-Aware Test-Time Augmented Ensembling of BERTs for producing reliable and well-calibrated predictions to classify six possible types of mental illnesses- None, Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar Disorder, ADHD, and PTSD by analyzing unstructured user data on Reddit.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented for the earlier diagnosis and classification of AD using MRI images, the ADNI 3 class of images with the total number of 1512 mild, 2633 normal and 2480 AD were used and a significant accuracy of 99% achieved. Alzheimer \u2019s Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia that can lead to a neurological brain disorder that causes progressive memory loss as a result of damaging the brain cells and the ability to perform daily activities. Using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scan brain images, we can get the help of Artificial intelligence (AI) technology for detection and prediction of this disease and classify the AD patients whether they have or may not have this deadly disease in future. The main purpose of doing all this is to make the best prediction and detection tools for the help of radiologists, doctors, caregivers to save time, cost, and help the patient suffering from this disease. In recent years, the Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are very useful for the diagnosis of AD as DL algorithms work well with large datasets. In this paper, we have implemented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the earlier diagnosis and classification of AD using MRI images, the ADNI 3 class of images with the total number of 1512 mild, 2633 normal and 2480 AD were used. A significant accuracy of 99% achieved in which the model performed well as we compared with many other related works. Furthermore, we also compared the result with our previous work on which ma-chine learning algorithms were applied using OASIS dataset and it showed that when dealing with large amount of data like medical data the deep learning approaches can be a better option over the traditional machine learning techniques.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, pro\u00adgressive neurological disorder that causes memory and thinking skill loss. Many different methods and algorithms have been applied to extract patterns from neuroimaging data in order to distinguish different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the similarity of the brain patterns in older adults and in different stages makes the classification of different stages a challenge for researchers. In this paper, convolutional neuronal network architecture AlexNet was applied to fMRI datasets to classify different stages of the disease. We classified five different stages of Alzheimer's us\u00ading a deep learning algorithm. The method successfully classified normal healthy control (NC), significant memory concern (SMC), early mild cognitive impair (EMCI), late cognitive mild impair (LMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The model was imple\u00admented using GPU high performance computing. Before applying any classification, the fMRI data were strictly preprocessed. Then, low to high level features were extracted and learned using the AlexNet model. Our experiments show significant improvement in classification. The average accuracy of the model was 97.63%. We then tested our model on test datasets to evaluate the accuracy of the model per class, obtaining an accuracy of 94.97% for AD, 95.64% for EMCI, 95.89% for LMCI, 98.34% for NC, and 94.55% for SMC.",

        "abstract": "This work investigates the relevance of a recently proposed set of pragmatic features extracted from an automatically generated topic hierarchy graph in combination with a complementary set of state-of-the-art features encoding lexical, syntactic and semantic cues and an analysis of the errors introduced by a speech recognition system. Clinical literature provides convincing evidence that language deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) allow for distinguishing patients with dementia from healthy subjects. Currently, computational approaches have widely investigated lexicosemantic aspects of discourse production, while pragmatic aspects like cohesion and coherence, are still mostly unexplored. In this article, we aim at providing a more comprehensive characterization of language abilities for the automatic identification of AD in narrative description tasks by also incorporating pragmatic aspects of speech production. To this end, we investigate the relevance of a recently proposed set of pragmatic features extracted from an automatically generated topic hierarchy graph in combination with a complementary set of state-of-the-art features encoding lexical, syntactic and semantic cues. Experimental results on the DementiaBank corpus show an accuracy improvement from 82.6% to 85.5% in identifying AD patients when pragmatic features are incorporated to the set of lexicosemantic features. Nevertheless, these results are obtained relying on manual transcriptions, which strongly limits the applicability of computational analysis to clinical settings. Thus, in this work we additionally carry out an analysis of the errors introduced by a speech recognition system and the way in which they impact the performance of the proposed method. In spite of the high word error rates obtained on these data (\u223c40%), automatic AD identification accuracy decreased only to 79.7%, which is considered a remarkable result when compared with solutions based on manual transcriptions.",

Automatic prediction of cognitive assessment scores through analysis of speech is a challenging task not least due to the lack of available data; this is exacerbated by datasets often being accompanied by disparate cognitive scores as diagnostic practices vary across the world. The ADReSSo 2021 challenge aimed at supporting research in this area and defined a number of tasks including a regression task (predicting Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores). It saw the successful introduction of a number of BERT-based models including our winning classification approach that successfully applied data augmentation using ASR-generated hypotheses. In this paper, we port this approach to the regression task and further present an investiga-tion into the effect of combining smaller datasets with disparate cognitive scores. In particular, we combine the ADReSSo data with our in-house IVA dataset, which is associated with a different type of cognitive assessment: the Addenbrooke\u2019s Cognitive Examination (ACE-III). We show improved performance by converting ACE-III to MMSE scores thus enabling us to combine the two datasets. By selecting good hyper-parameters, the RMSE reduces from 4.45 to 4.40 on the ADReSSo task. Likewise, using the ADReSSo dataset to boost the IVA regression model, decreases RMSE from 3.50 to 3.00 .",

        "abstract": "An FC measure is introduced that rests upon assessments of functional coherence between regional brain activity identified from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and a unified Bayesian framework for analyzing FC utilizing the knowledge of associated structural connections is presented. Recent innovations in neuroimaging technology have provided opportunities for researchers to investigate connectivity in the human brain by examining the anatomical circuitry as well as functional relationships between brain regions. Existing statistical approaches for connectivity generally examine resting-state or task-related functional connectivity (FC) between brain regions or separately examine structural linkages. As a means to determine brain networks, we present a unified Bayesian framework for analyzing FC utilizing the knowledge of associated structural connections, which extends an approach by Patel et al. (2006a) that considers only functional data. We introduce an FC measure that rests upon assessments of functional coherence between regional brain activity identified from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Our structural connectivity (SC) information is drawn from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, which is used to quantify probabilities of SC between brain regions. We formulate a prior distribution for FC that depends upon the probability of SC between brain regions, with this dependence adhering to structural-functional links revealed by our fMRI and DTI data. We further characterize the functional hierarchy of functionally connected brain regions by defining an ascendancy measure that compares the marginal probabilities of elevated activity between regions. In addition, we describe topological properties of the network, which is composed of connected region pairs, by performing graph theoretic analyses. We demonstrate the use of our Bayesian model using fMRI and DTI data from a study of auditory processing. We further illustrate the advantages of our method by comparisons to methods that only incorporate functional information.",

        "abstract": "A study consisting of a semi-standardized history taking followed by two standardized neuropsychological tests, namely the SKT and the CERAD-NB shows that using word alternatives helps to mitigate recognition errors and subsequently improves correlation with expert scores. For dementia screening and monitoring, standardized tests play a key role in clinical routine since they aim at minimizing subjectivity by measuring performance on a variety of cognitive tasks. In this paper, we report a study consisting of a semi-standardized history taking followed by two standardized neuropsychological tests, namely the SKT and the CERAD-NB. The tests include basic tasks such as naming objects, learning word lists, but also widely used tools such as the MMSE. Most of the tasks are performed verbally and should thus be suitable for automated scoring based on transcripts. For the first batch of 30 patients, we analyze the correlation between expert manual evaluations and automatic evaluations based on manual and automatic transcriptions. For both SKT and CERAD-NB, we observe high to perfect correlations using manual transcripts; for certain tasks with lower correlation, the automatic scoring is stricter than the human reference since it is limited to the audio. Using automatic transcriptions, correlations drop as expected and are related to recognition accuracy; however, we still observe high correlations of up to 0.98 (SKT) and 0.85 (CERAD-NB). We show that using word alternatives helps to mitigate recognition errors and subsequently improves correlation with expert scores.",

        "abstract": "Using a Machine Learning model, a highly accurate protein structure is obtained by applying SidechainNet as its dataset, which can be used to predict and classify the structure of proteins more accurately. Proteins are the main building blocks for any form of life known to us as of now, and it is the actuators of biophysical and chemical events occurring in living organisms. Biological functions are enabled by their naive structure, which plays a very important and crucial role in the design of vaccines and drugs. This acts as one of the main sources of motivation in predicting protein structure from its sequence of amino acids coupled with other information to get highly accurate prediction and classification, which indeed is one of the fundamental computational biology problems. As of now, not much focus has been given to the inclusion of sidechain structure information and prediction of the protein backbone. In this paper, it is shown that a new dataset called SidechainNet, which extends from the ProteinNet dataset, can be used to predict and classify the structure of proteins more accurately. This is because SidechainNet consists of angle and atomic coordinate information, which describes almost all the heavy atoms of each and every protein structure. The background information on the availability of data on the protein structure and the importance of ProteinNet is discussed. It is followed by the beneficial inclusion of additional information that SidechainNet has, which helps in predicting the structure of the protein more accurately. At last, it is shown how using a Machine Learning model, a highly accurate protein structure is obtained by applying SidechainNet as its dataset.",

        "abstract": "This analysis uncovers an additional regularization effect of large learning rates beyond the linear scaling rule that penalizes large eigenvalues of the Hessian more than small ones. In overparametrized models, the noise in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) implicitly regularizes the optimization trajectory and determines which local minimum SGD converges to. Motivated by empirical studies that demonstrate that training with noisy labels improves generalization, we study the implicit regularization effect of SGD with label noise. We show that SGD with label noise converges to a stationary point of a regularized loss L ( \u03b8 )+ \u03bbR ( \u03b8 ) , where L ( \u03b8 ) is the training loss, \u03bb is an effective regularization parameter depending on the step size, strength of the label noise, and the batch size, and R ( \u03b8 ) is an explicit regularizer that penalizes sharp minimizers. Our analysis uncovers an additional regularization effect of large learning rates beyond the linear scaling rule that penalizes large eigenvalues of the Hessian more than small ones. We also prove extensions to classi\ufb01cation with general loss functions, signi\ufb01cantly strengthening the prior work of Blanc et al.

        "abstract": "This paper conducts extensive experiments with the pre-trained BERT model on three natural language understanding (NLU) tasks and demonstrates thatparse and robust subnetworks (SRNets) can consistently be found in BERT, and explores the upper bound of SRNets using the OOD information. Despite the remarkable success of pre-trained language models (PLMs), they still face two challenges: First, large-scale PLMs are inefficient in terms of memory footprint and computation. Second, on the downstream tasks, PLMs tend to rely on the dataset bias and struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In response to the efficiency problem, recent studies show that dense PLMs can be replaced with sparse subnetworks without hurting the performance. Such subnetworks can be found in three scenarios: 1) the fine-tuned PLMs, 2) the raw PLMs and then fine-tuned in isolation, and even inside 3) PLMs without any parameter fine-tuning. However, these results are only obtained in the in-distribution (ID) setting. In this paper, we extend the study on PLMs subnetworks to the OOD setting, investigating whether sparsity and robustness to dataset bias can be achieved simultaneously. To this end, we conduct extensive experiments with the pre-trained BERT model on three natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. Our results demonstrate that \\textbf{sparse and robust subnetworks (SRNets) can consistently be found in BERT}, across the aforementioned three scenarios, using different training and compression methods. Furthermore, we explore the upper bound of SRNets using the OOD information and show that \\textbf{there exist sparse and almost unbiased BERT subnetworks}. Finally, we present 1) an analytical study that provides insights on how to promote the efficiency of SRNets searching process and 2) a solution to improve subnetworks' performance at high sparsity.

Sentence ordering aims at restoring orders of shuffled sentences in a paragraph. Previous methods usually predict orders in a single direction, i.e., from head to tail. However, unidirectional prediction inevitably causes error accumulation, which restricts performance. In this article, we propose a bidirectional ordering method, which predicts orders in both head-to-tail and tail-to-head directions at the same time. In our bidirectional ordering method, two directions can interact with each other and help alleviate the error accumulation problem of ordering. Experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively improve performance of previous models.",

Education public opinion information management is an important research focus in the field of Education Data Mining (EDM). In this paper, we classify the education data information based on the traditional Flat-OCC model. From the cognitive psychology perspective, we identify up to 12 kinds of emotions, including sadness and happiness. In addition, the EMO-CBOW model is also proposed in this paper to further identify emotion by using various emoticons in educational data sets. The empirical result shows that (1) the proposed Flat-OCC model can classify and identify the emotion of education public opinion data well; and (2) for the recognition of educational emotion classification, the categorization accuracy of the Flat-OCC+EMO-CBOW model is significantly higher than that of a single Flat-OCC model, which reveals that the emotional-pack-based model we propose can enhance our benchmark model.",

        "abstract": "The adoption of EHR systems in developed and developing nations is investigated, as well as the review concludes with an examination of various artificial intelligence techniques, particularly machine learning algorithms for medical acronym and abbreviation disambiguation in EHRs. The adoption of Electronic Health Record (EHR) and other e-health infrastructures over the years has been characterized by an increase in medical errors. This is primarily a result of the widespread usage of medical acronyms and abbreviations with multiple possible senses (i.e., ambiguous acronyms). The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP), has presented a promising avenue for tackling the intricate issue of automatic sense resolution of acronyms. Notably, the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques has proven to be highly effective in the development of systems aimed at this objective, garnering significant attention and interest within the research and industry domains in recent years. The significance of automating the resolution of medical acronym senses cannot be overstated, especially in the context of modern healthcare delivery with the widespread use of EHR. However, it is disheartening to note that comprehensive studies examining the global adoption of EHR, assessing the impact of acronym usage on medical errors within EHR systems, and reporting on the latest trends and advancements in ML-based NLP solutions for disambiguating medical acronyms remain severely limited. In this current study, we present a detailed overview on medical error, its origins, unintended effects, and EHR-related errors as a subclass of clinical error. Furthermore, this paper investigates the adoption of EHR systems in developed and developing nations, as well as the review concludes with an examination of various artificial intelligence techniques, particularly machine learning algorithms for medical acronym and abbreviation disambiguation in EHRs.",

        "abstract": "Current limitations associated with the use of hiPSCs in cardiovascular research are addressed as well as future promising avenues to create \u201chearts in a dish.\u201d A major limitation in studies aimed at investigating the molecular bases and pathogenetic mechanisms in cardiac disease is the limited availability of cellular models capable of reproducing the characteristics of the disease in humans. While several in vivo models of cardiac disease spanning small and large animal models are available to date (Patten and HallPorter, 2009; Tsang et al., 2016), the bulk of in cellulo studies is based on primary cultures and cell lines (Savoji et al., 2019). All these models are certainly useful, but each of them has limitations which likely contributed to the limited translatability of in cellulo models. Indeed, two limitations with primary cultures from adult animals are their short viability once plated, and operator-dependent quality. On the other hand, the main shortcomings with cell lines or primary cultures obtained from neonatal animals (especially rat and mouse) are likely their lack of ultrastructure and immature metabolism. The discovery of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) came with the promise to model many different human diseases in a dish and study the underlying cell pathobiology, or even establish in vitro assays for drug discovery/toxicity. Given that cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the largest killer worldwide, the optimization of protocols to obtain hiPSC-derived cardiac myocytes (hiPSC-CMs) has received a lot of attention and funding. However, the heart is a complex organ comprising an ever growing number of cell types and a unique spatial architecture needed to sustain the efficient propagation of depolarization and synchronous contraction. Overall, the translational value of mouse models has proven low (Nerbonne, 2004) and recent improvements in tissue engineering could help overcoming current limitations associated with the use of hiPSCs in cardiovascular research. Current main strategies to obtain cardiac models from hiPSCs are outlined in Figure 1. In this viewpoint we address current limitations with these models as well as future promising avenues to create \u201chearts in a dish.\u201d",

        "abstract": "A novel approach to remove irrelevant samples from the real-world web images during training, and only utilize useful images for updating the networks is proposed, which can alleviate the harmful effects caused by irrelevant noisy web images to achieve better performance. Labeling objects at the subordinate level typically requires expert knowledge, which is not always available from a random annotator. Accordingly, learning directly from web images for fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) has attracted broad attention. However, the existence of noise in web images is a huge obstacle for training robust deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to remove irrelevant samples from the real-world web images during training, and only utilize useful images for updating the networks. Thus, our network can alleviate the harmful effects caused by irrelevant noisy web images to achieve better performance. Extensive experiments on three commonly used fine-grained datasets demonstrate that our approach is much superior to state-of-the-art webly supervised methods.

The number of people affected by mental illness is on the increase and with it the burden on health and social care use, as well as the loss of both productivity and quality-adjusted life-years. Natural language processing of electronic health records is increasingly used to study mental health conditions and risk behaviours on a large scale. However, narrative notes written by clinicians do not capture first-hand the patients\u2019 own experiences, and only record cross-sectional, professional impressions at the point of care. Social media platforms have become a source of \u2018in the moment\u2019 daily exchange, with topics including well-being and mental health. In this study, we analysed posts from the social media platform Reddit and developed classifiers to recognise and classify posts related to mental illness according to 11 disorder themes. Using a neural network and deep learning approach, we could automatically recognise mental illness-related posts in our balenced dataset with an accuracy of 91.08% and select the correct theme with a weighted average accuracy of 71.37%. We believe that these results are a first step in developing methods to characterise large amounts of user-generated content that could support content curation and targeted interventions.",

        "abstract": "This study successfully proved that implementation of dropouts in the CNN model can improve the model accuracy and reduce the model training duration, and made valuable insights for medical image diagnosis and future research. Alzheimer's disease is a well-known brain disorder which currently still does not have a cure. However, early diagnosis of the disease can help the patient to get proper treatment and slow down the progressiveness of the disease. In medical imaging, deep learning methods have been widely used to assist the medical professionals in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis to classify the normal brain and the stages of Alzheimer's disease. This paper compares the classification performance of deep learning architecture such as MobileNetV2, ResNet-101, DenseNet-121, and the proposed modified convolutional neural network (CNN) model inspired by the VGG16 network using a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset from Kaggle. We evaluate the model performance based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score and the obtained results show that the classification of Alzheimer's disease using our proposed model is more accurate than the other model with 97.625% accuracy, 98% recall, 98% precision and 98% F1-score. Our study successfully proved that implementation of dropouts in the CNN model can improve the model accuracy and reduce the model training duration, and made valuable insights for medical image diagnosis and future research.",

        "abstract": "The findings indicate that advanced deep learning with MRI images can be used to classify and predict neurodegenerative brain diseases such as AD. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects brain cells, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been defined as the early phase that describes the onset of AD. Early detection of MCI can be used to save patient brain cells from further damage and direct additional medical treatment to prevent its progression. Lately, the use of deep learning for the early identification of AD has generated a lot of interest. However, one of the limitations of such algorithms is their inability to identify changes in the functional connectivity in the functional brain network of patients with MCI. In this paper, we attempt to elucidate this issue with randomized concatenated deep features obtained from two pre-trained models, which simultaneously learn deep features from brain functional networks from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. We experimented with ResNet18 and DenseNet201 to perform the task of AD multiclass classification. A gradient class activation map was used to mark the discriminating region of the image for the proposed model prediction. Accuracy, precision, and recall were used to assess the performance of the proposed system. The experimental analysis showed that the proposed model was able to achieve 98.86% accuracy, 98.94% precision, and 98.89% recall in multiclass classification. The findings indicate that advanced deep learning with MRI images can be used to classify and predict neurodegenerative brain diseases such as AD.",

        "abstract": "A deep learning-based method that can predict MCI, earlyMCI (EMCI), late MCI (LMCI), and AD, and the proposed model performed better than other known models in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. One of the first signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is mild cognitive impairment (MCI), in which there are small variants of brain changes among the intermediate stages. Although there has been an increase in research into the diagnosis of AD in its early levels of developments lately, brain changes, and their complexity for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), makes early detection of AD difficult. This paper proposes a deep learning-based method that can predict MCI, early MCI (EMCI), late MCI (LMCI), and AD. The Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) fMRI dataset consisting of 138 subjects was used for evaluation. The finetuned ResNet18 network achieved a classification accuracy of 99.99%, 99.95%, and 99.95% on EMCI vs. AD, LMCI vs. AD, and MCI vs. EMCI classification scenarios, respectively. The proposed model performed better than other known models in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses ACS issues concerning credit scoring in a batch of machine learning problems, namely, feature irregularities due to empty features in many records, class imbalance due to non-uniform statistical distributions of the records between classes, and concept drift due to changing statistical characteristics concerning certain classes and features with time. Automated Credit Scoring (ACS) is the process of predicting user credit based on historical data. It involves analysing and predicting the association between the data and particular credit values based on similar data. Recently, ACS has been handled as a machine learning problem, and numerous models were developed to address it. In this paper, we address ACS issues concerning credit scoring in a batch of machine learning problems, namely, feature irregularities due to empty features in many records, class imbalance due to non-uniform statistical distributions of the records between classes, and concept drift due to changing statistical characteristics concerning certain classes and features with time. Considering the limited credit scoring data volume, we propose to address the challenge using the Transfer Learning with Lag (TLL) algorithm based on embedded shallow neural networks that enable knowledge transfer when the number of active features changes. Knowledge transfer is based on lags having an adaptive length that is changed based on performance change feedback. Furthermore, the framework proposes classifier aggregation and the chunk balancing mechanism for handling class imbalance. An evaluation was conducted using the Lending club, German, Default, and PPDai datasets. The results show the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the benchmarks in terms of the majority of classification metrics concerning both time series and overall results. TLL offered improvements of 58.6% and 28.2% over FA-OSELM and OSELM using the Lending club dataset.",

The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a standardized cognitive health screening test. It is generally administered by trained clinicians, which may be time-consuming and costly. An intriguing and scalable alternative is to detect changes in cognitive function by automatically monitoring individuals\u2019 memory and language abilities from their conversational narratives. We work towards doing so by predicting clinical MMSE scores using verbal and non-verbal features extracted from the transcripts of 108 speech samples from the ADReSS Challenge dataset. We achieve a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 4.34, a percentage decrease of 29.3% over the existing performance benchmark. We also explore the performance impacts of acoustic versus linguistic, text-based features and find that linguistic features achieve lower RMSE scores, providing strong positive support for their inclusion in future MMSE score prediction models. Our best-performing model leverages a selection of verbal and non-verbal cues, demonstrating that MMSE score prediction is a rich problem that is best addressed using input from multiple perspectives.",

        "abstract": "The feasibility of using speech to classify AD and predict neuropsychological scores is illustrated and the top-performing classification models were the support vector machine and random forest classifiers trained on BERT embeddings, which both achieved an accuracy of 85.4% on the test set. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a form of dementia that affects the memory, cognition, and motor skills of patients. Extensive research has been done to develop accessible, cost-effective, and non-invasive techniques for the automatic detection of AD. Previous research has shown that speech can be used to distinguish between healthy patients and afflicted patients. In this paper, the ADReSS dataset, a dataset balanced by gender and age, was used to automatically classify AD from spontaneous speech. The performance of five classifiers, as well as a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network, was compared when trained on audio features (i-vectors and x-vectors) and text features (word vectors, BERT embeddings, LIWC features, and CLAN features). The same audio and text features were used to train five regression models to predict the Mini-Mental State Examination score for each patient, a score that has a maximum value of 30. The top-performing classification models were the support vector machine and random forest classifiers trained on BERT embeddings, which both achieved an accuracy of 85.4% on the test set. The best-performing regression model was the gradient boosting regression model trained on BERT embeddings and CLAN features, which had a root mean squared error of 4.56 on the test set. The performance on both tasks illustrates the feasibility of using speech to classify AD and predict neuropsychological scores.",

        "abstract": "A constrained Bayesian ICA approach is investigated which, in comparison to current methods, simultaneously allows the flexible integration of multiple sources of information and an automatic and parameter-free selection of the appropriate sparsity level and number of connected submodules. Brain connectomics is a developing field in neurosciences which strives to understand cognitive processes and psychiatric diseases through the analysis of interactions between brain regions. However, in the high-dimensional, low-sample, and noisy regimes that typically characterize fMRI data, the recovery of such interactions remains an ongoing challenge: how can we discover patterns of co-activity between brain regions that could then be associated to cognitive processes or psychiatric disorders? In this paper, we investigate a constrained Bayesian ICA approach which, in comparison to current methods, simultaneously allows (a) the flexible integration of multiple sources of information (fMRI, DWI, anatomical, etc.), (b) an automatic and parameter-free selection of the appropriate sparsity level and number of connected submodules and (c) the provision of estimates on the uncertainty of the recovered interactions.

In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.",

The Clock Drawing Test is used as a cognitive assessment tool in geriatrics to detect signs of dementia or to model the progress of stroke recovery. The result is scored manually by a trained professional. We implement the Mendez scoring scheme and create a hierarchy of error categories that model the test characteristics of the clock drawing test, based on a set of impaired clock examples provided by a geriatrics clinic. Using a digital pen we recorded 120 clock samples for evaluating the automatic scoring system, with a total of 2400 error samples distributed over the 20 error classes of the Mendez scoring scheme. Error classes are scored automatically using a handwriting and gesture recognition framework. Results show that we provide a clinically relevant cognitive model for each subject. In addition, we heavily reduce the time spent on manual scoring. We compare manual scoring results with results produced by our automated system.",

        "abstract": "The implicit regularization of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) through the lens of {\\em dynamical stability} (Wu et al., 2018) is studied, establishing the {\\em equivalence} between these metrics of sharpness and certain parameter norms for the two models, which allows to show that the stable minima of SGD provably generalize well. In this paper, we study the implicit regularization of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) through the lens of {\\em dynamical stability} (Wu et al., 2018). We start by revising existing stability analyses of SGD, showing how the Frobenius norm and trace of Hessian relate to different notions of stability. Notably, if a global minimum is linearly stable for SGD, then the trace of Hessian must be less than or equal to $2/\\eta$, where $\\eta$ denotes the learning rate. By contrast, for gradient descent (GD), the stability imposes a similar constraint but only on the largest eigenvalue of Hessian. We then turn to analyze the generalization properties of these stable minima, focusing specifically on two-layer ReLU networks and diagonal linear networks. Notably, we establish the {\\em equivalence} between these metrics of sharpness and certain parameter norms for the two models, which allows us to show that the stable minima of SGD provably generalize well. By contrast, the stability-induced regularization of GD is provably too weak to ensure satisfactory generalization. This discrepancy provides an explanation of why SGD often generalizes better than GD. Note that the learning rate (LR) plays a pivotal role in the strength of stability-induced regularization. As the LR increases, the regularization effect becomes more pronounced, elucidating why SGD with a larger LR consistently demonstrates superior generalization capabilities. Additionally, numerical experiments are provided to support our theoretical findings.",

        "abstract": "This work finds that dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks (\"winning tickets\") that - when trained in isolation - reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations, and articulate the \"lottery ticket hypothesis\". Neural network pruning techniques can reduce the parameter counts of trained networks by over 90%, decreasing storage requirements and improving computational performance of inference without compromising accuracy. However, contemporary experience is that the sparse architectures produced by pruning are difficult to train from the start, which would similarly improve training performance. \nWe find that a standard pruning technique naturally uncovers subnetworks whose initializations made them capable of training effectively. Based on these results, we articulate the \"lottery ticket hypothesis:\" dense, randomly-initialized, feed-forward networks contain subnetworks (\"winning tickets\") that - when trained in isolation - reach test accuracy comparable to the original network in a similar number of iterations. The winning tickets we find have won the initialization lottery: their connections have initial weights that make training particularly effective. \nWe present an algorithm to identify winning tickets and a series of experiments that support the lottery ticket hypothesis and the importance of these fortuitous initializations. We consistently find winning tickets that are less than 10-20% of the size of several fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward architectures for MNIST and CIFAR10. Above this size, the winning tickets that we find learn faster than the original network and reach higher test accuracy.",

We propose an end-to-end unsupervised deep learning approach based on the set-to-sequence framework to address this problem. Our model strongly outperforms prior methods in the order discrimination task and a novel task of ordering abstracts from scientific articles. Furthermore, our work shows that useful text representations can be obtained by learning to order sentences. Visualizing the learned sentence representations shows that the model captures high-level logical structure in paragraphs.

In the community of sentiment analysis, supervised learning techniques have been shown to perform very well. When transferred to another domain, however, a supervised sentiment classifier often performs extremely bad. This is so-called domain-transfer problem. In this work, we attempt to attack this problem by making the maximum use of both the old-domain data and the unlabeled new-domain data. To leverage knowledge from the old-domain data, we proposed an effective measure, i.e., Frequently Co-occurring Entropy (FCE), to pick out generalizable features that occur frequently in both domains and have similar occurring probability. To gain knowledge from the new-domain data, we proposed Adapted Naive Bayes (ANB), a weighted transfer version of Naive Bayes Classifier. The experimental results indicate that proposed approach could improve the performance of base classifier dramatically, and even provide much better performance than the transfer-learning baseline, i.e. the Naive Bayes Transfer Classifier (NTBC).",

        "abstract": "A novel two-stage deep learning AD progression detection framework based on information fusion of several patient longitudinal multivariate modalities, including neuroimaging data, cognitive scores, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, neuropsychological battery markers, and demographics is proposed. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease characterized by thinking, behavioral and memory impairments. Early prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD is still a challenging task. No study has been able to predict the exact conversion time of MCI patients. In addition, most studies have achieved poor performance making this prediction using only a small number of features (e.g., using only MRI images). Therefore, previous approaches have not gained the trust of medical experts. This study proposes a novel two-stage deep learning AD progression detection framework based on information fusion of several patient longitudinal multivariate modalities, including neuroimaging data, cognitive scores, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, neuropsychological battery markers, and demographics. The first stage of the progression detection framework employs a multiclass classification task that predicts a patient\u2019s diagnosis (i.e., cognitively normal, MCI, or AD). In the second stage, a regression task that predicts the exact conversion time of MCI patients is used. The study is based on data of 1,371 subjects collected by the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Comprehensive experiments were carried out to evaluate the framework stages and find the optimal model for each stage. Proposed model was compared with various machine learning models, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). In the classification stage, the proposed long-short term memory (LSTM) model achieved an accuracy of 93.87%, precision of 94.070%, recall of 94.07%, and F1-score of 94.07%. The results showed that the LSTM model outperformed other machine learning models (i.e., decision tree by 2.48%, random forest by 1.27%, support vector machine by 1.86%, logistic regression by 1.59%, and K-nearest neighbor by 14.77%). In the regression stage, the proposed LSTM model achieved the best results (i.e., mean absolute error of 0.1375). Compared to other regular regressors, this LSTM model achieved less errors (i.e., 0.0064, 0.0152, 0.0338, 0.0118, 0.0198, and 0.0066, compared to DT, RF, SVM, LR, and KNN, respectively). By learning deep representation from patient high-dimensional longitudinal time-series data, the proposed LSTM model was more stable and medically acceptable. The framework may have a clinical impact as a predictive tool for AD progression detection due to its accurate results to predict the exact conversion time of MCI cases using patient time-series multimodalities data.",

        "abstract": "The patterned human heart tube model constitutes a powerful in vitro tool for dissecting the role of different cell types and genes in human heart development, as well as disease modeling congenital heart defects, and represents a step forward in creating fully synthetic human hearts. Human pluripotent stem cells can recapitulate significant features of mammalian organ development in vitro, including key aspects of heart development. We hypothesized that the organoids thus created can be made substantially more relevant by mimicking aspects of in utero gestation, leading to higher physiological and anatomical resemblance to their in vivo counterparts. Here, we report steps towards generating developmentally inspired maturation methodologies to differentiate early human heart organoids into patterned heart-tube-like structures in a reproducible and high-throughput fashion by complete self-organization. The maturation strategy consists of the controlled and stepwise exposure to metabolic (glucose, fatty acids) and hormonal signals (T3, IGF-1) as present during early heart development. These conditions elicit important transcriptomic, cellular, morphological, metabolomic, and functional changes over a 10-day period consistent with continuously increasing heart complexity, maturation, and patterning. Our data reveals the emergence of atrial and ventricular cardiomyocyte populations, valvular cells, epicardial cells, proepicardial-derived cells, endothelial cells, stromal cells, conductance cells, and cardiac progenitors, all of them cell types present in the primitive heart tube. Anatomically, the organoids elongate and develop well-differentiated atrial and ventricular chambers with compacted myocardial muscle walls and a proepicardial organ. For the first time in a completely self-organizing heart organoid, we show anterior-posterior patterning due to an endogenous retinoic acid gradient originating at the atrial pole, where proepicardial and atrial populations reside, mimicking the developmental process present within the primitive heart tube. Collectively, these findings highlight the ability of self-organization and developmental maturation strategies to recapitulate human heart development. Our patterned human heart tube model constitutes a powerful in vitro tool for dissecting the role of different cell types and genes in human heart development, as well as disease modeling congenital heart defects, and represents a step forward in creating fully synthetic human hearts.",

A prototype positron emission tomography (PET) scanner using CdTe semiconductor detectors was developed, and its initial evaluation was conducted. The scanner was configured to form a single detector ring with six separated detector units, each having 96 detectors arranged in three detector layers. The field of view (FOV) size was 82 mm in diameter. Basic physical performance indicators of the scanner were measured through phantom studies and confirmed by rat imaging. The system-averaged energy resolution and timing resolution were 5.4% and 6.0 ns (each in FWHM) respectively. Spatial resolution measured at FOV center was 2.6 mm FWHM. Scatter fraction was measured and calculated in a National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA)-fashioned manner using a 3-mm diameter hot capillary in a water-filled 80-mm diameter acrylic cylinder. The calculated result was 3.6%. Effect of depth of interaction (DOI) measurement was demonstrated by comparing hot-rod phantom images reconstructed with and without DOI information. Finally, images of a rat myocardium and an implanted tumor were visually assessed, and the imaging performance was confirmed.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a Few-shot guided Prototypical (FoPro) representation learning method, which only needs a few labeled examples from reality and can significantly improve the performance in the real-world domain. Recently, webly supervised learning (WSL) has been studied to leverage numerous and accessible data from the Internet. Most existing methods focus on learning noise-robust models from web images while neglecting the performance drop caused by the differences between web domain and real-world domain. However, only by tackling the performance gap above can we fully exploit the practical value of web datasets. To this end, we propose a Few-shot guided Prototypical (FoPro) representation learning method, which only needs a few labeled examples from reality and can significantly improve the performance in the real-world domain. Specifically, we initialize each class center with few-shot real-world data as the ``realistic\"prototype. Then, the intra-class distance between web instances and ``realistic\"prototypes is narrowed by contrastive learning. Finally, we measure image-prototype distance with a learnable metric. Prototypes are polished by adjacent high-quality web images and involved in removing distant out-of-distribution samples. In experiments, FoPro is trained on web datasets with a few real-world examples guided and evaluated on real-world datasets. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on three fine-grained datasets and two large-scale datasets. Compared with existing WSL methods under the same few-shot settings, FoPro still excels in real-world generalization. Code is available at https://github.com/yuleiqin/fopro.",

        "abstract": "The common approaches for predicting and identifying the disorder using user-generated content using machine learning techniques are described and can help complement screening procedures, identify at-risk people through social media monitoring on a large scale, and make disorders easier to treat in the future. Mental disorders such as depression and suicidal ideation are hazardous, affecting more than 300 million people over the world. However, on social media, mental disorder symptoms can be observed, and automated approaches are increasingly capable of detecting them. The considerable number of social media users and the tremendous quantity of user-generated data on social platforms provide a unique opportunity for researchers to distinguish patterns that correlate with mental status. This research offers a roadmap for analysis, where mental state detection can be based on machine learning techniques. We describe the common approaches for predicting and identifying the disorder using user-generated content. This research is organized according to the data collection, feature extraction, and prediction algorithms. Furthermore, we review several recent studies conducted to explore different features of candidate profiles and their analytical methods. Following, we debate various aspects of the development of experimental auto-detection frameworks for identifying users who suffer from disorders, and we conclude with a discussion of future trends. The introduced methods can help complement screening procedures, identify at-risk people through social media monitoring on a large scale, and make disorders easier to treat in the future.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new CNN architecture for detecting Alzheimer\u2019s disease with relatively few parameters, and the proposed solution is ideal for training a smaller dataset. Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) is a neurological brain disorder marked by dementia and neurological dysfunction that affects memory, behavioral patterns, and reasoning. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is an incurable disease that primarily affects people over 40. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is diagnosed through a manual evaluation of a patient\u2019s MRI scan and neuro-psychological examinations. Deep Learning (DL), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has pioneered new approaches to automate medical image diagnosis. This study aims to create a reliable and efficient system for classifying AD using MRI by applying the deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In this paper, we propose a new CNN architecture for detecting AD with relatively few parameters, and the proposed solution is ideal for training a smaller dataset. This proposed model successfully distinguishes the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and shows class activation maps as a heat map on the brain. The proposed Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Detection Network (ADD-Net) is built from scratch to precisely classify the stages of AD by decreasing parameters and calculation costs. The Kaggle MRI image dataset has a significant class imbalance problem, and we exploited a synthetic oversampling technique to evenly distribute the image among the classes to prevent the problem of class imbalance. The proposed ADD-Net is extensively evaluated against DenseNet169, VGG19, and InceptionResNet V2 using precision, recall, F1-score, Area Under the Curve (AUC), and loss. The ADD-Net achieved the following values for evaluation metrics: 98.63%, 99.76%, 98.61%, 98.63%, 98.58%, and 0.0549% accuracy, AUC, F1-score, precision, recall, and loss, respectively. The simulation results show that the proposed ADD-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art models in all the evaluation metrics.",

ABSTRACT Magnetic Resonance Imaging helps in detecting brain atrophy caused by Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Morphological changes start to occur in the temporal lobe of the brain in persons affected by AD. A 3D Convolutional Neural Network is proposed that focuses on the temporal lobe of the brain for AD classification from normal controls. By investigating the temporal region of the grey matter in the brain instead of the entire brain region high performance is obtained with an accuracy of 88.06%, a sensitivity of 94.03%, and a specificity of 82.09% in classifying the MRI volumes of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-2) dataset. When Apolipoprotein \u03b54 allele information and mini-mental state examination scores are used with the MRI volumes, an accuracy of 89.55%, a sensitivity of 82.09% and a specificity of 97.01% for ADNI-2 MRI volumes are achieved. When tested on ADNI-3 MRI volumes the proposed method resulted in an accuracy of 90.14%, a sensitivity of 79.17% and a specificity of 92.37%.",

        "abstract": "A comprehensive survey of DTL-based ASR frameworks to shed light on the latest developments and helps academics and professionals understand current challenges and derive opportunities for future research is presented. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has recently become an important challenge when using deep learning (DL). It requires large-scale training datasets and high computational and storage resources. Moreover, DL techniques and machine learning (ML) approaches in general, hypothesize that training and testing data come from the same domain, with the same input feature space and data distribution characteristics. This assumption, however, is not applicable in some real-world artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Moreover, there are situations where gathering real data is challenging, expensive, or rarely occurring, which can not meet the data requirements of DL models. deep transfer learning (DTL) has been introduced to overcome these issues, which helps develop high-performing models using real datasets that are small or slightly different but related to the training data. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of DTL-based ASR frameworks to shed light on the latest developments and helps academics and professionals understand current challenges. Specifically, after presenting the DTL background, a well-designed taxonomy is adopted to inform the state-of-the-art. A critical analysis is then conducted to identify the limitations and advantages of each framework. Moving on, a comparative study is introduced to highlight the current challenges before deriving opportunities for future research.",

        "abstract": "This work compares and contrast the performance of ten linear regression models for predicting Mini-Mental Status Exam scores on the ADReSS challenge dataset, and finds that, for the given task, handcrafted linguistic features are more significant than acoustic and learned features. The average life expectancy is increasing globally due to advancements in medical technology, preventive health care, and a growing emphasis on gerontological health. Therefore, developing technologies that detect and track aging-associated disease in cognitive function among older adult populations is imperative. In particular, research related to automatic detection and evaluation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical given the disease's prevalence and the cost of current methods. As AD impacts the acoustics of speech and vocabulary, natural language processing and machine learning provide promising techniques for reliably detecting AD. We compare and contrast the performance of ten linear regression models for predicting Mini-Mental Status Exam scores on the ADReSS challenge dataset. We extracted 13000+ handcrafted and learned features that capture linguistic and acoustic phenomena. Using a subset of 54 top features selected by two methods: (1) recursive elimination and (2) correlation scores, we outperform a state-of-the-art baseline for the same task. Upon scoring and evaluating the statistical significance of each of the selected subset of features for each model, we find that, for the given task, handcrafted linguistic features are more significant than acoustic and learned features.",

        "title": "Temporal Integration of Text Transcripts and Acoustic Features for Alzheimer's Diagnosis Based on Spontaneous Speech",
        "abstract": "The proposed combination of ADR audio and textual features is capable of successfully modelling temporal aspects of the data and achieves best performance when ADR features are combined with strong semantic bag-of-n-grams features. Background: Advances in machine learning (ML) technology have opened new avenues for detection and monitoring of cognitive decline. In this study, a multimodal approach to Alzheimer's dementia detection based on the patient's spontaneous speech is presented. This approach was tested on a standard, publicly available Alzheimer's speech dataset for comparability. The data comprise voice samples from 156 participants (1:1 ratio of Alzheimer's to control), matched by age and gender. Materials and Methods: A recently developed Active Data Representation (ADR) technique for voice processing was employed as a framework for fusion of acoustic and textual features at sentence and word level. Temporal aspects of textual features were investigated in conjunction with acoustic features in order to shed light on the temporal interplay between paralinguistic (acoustic) and linguistic (textual) aspects of Alzheimer's speech. Combinations between several configurations of ADR features and more traditional bag-of-n-grams approaches were used in an ensemble of classifiers built and evaluated on a standardised dataset containing recorded speech of scene descriptions and textual transcripts. Results: Employing only semantic bag-of-n-grams features, an accuracy of 89.58% was achieved in distinguishing between Alzheimer's patients and healthy controls. Adding temporal and structural information by combining bag-of-n-grams features with ADR audio/textual features, the accuracy could be improved to 91.67% on the test set. An accuracy of 93.75% was achieved through late fusion of the three best feature configurations, which corresponds to a 4.7% improvement over the best result reported in the literature for this dataset. Conclusion: The proposed combination of ADR audio and textual features is capable of successfully modelling temporal aspects of the data. The machine learning approach toward dementia detection achieves best performance when ADR features are combined with strong semantic bag-of-n-grams features. This combination leads to state-of-the-art performance on the AD classification task.",

Depth is one of the keys that make neural networks succeed in the task of large-scale image recognition. The state-of-the-art network architectures usually increase the depths by cascading convolutional layers or building blocks. In this paper, we present an alternative method to increase the depth. Our method is by introducing computation orderings to the channels within convolutional layers or blocks, based on which we gradually compute the outputs in a channel-wise manner. The added orderings not only increase the depths and the learning capacities of the networks without any additional computation costs, but also eliminate the overlap singularities so that the networks are able to converge faster and perform better. Experiments show that the networks based on our method achieve the state-of-the-art performances on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets.",

The Trail Making Test (TMT) is a frequently used neuropsychological test for assessing cognitive performance. The subject connects a sequence of numbered nodes by using a pen on normal paper. We present an automatic cognitive assessment tool that analyzes samples of the TMT which we record using a digital pen. This enables us to analyze digital pen features that are difficult or impossible to evaluate manually. Our system automatically measures several pen features, including the completion time which is the main performance indicator used by clinicians to score the TMT in practice. In addition, our system provides a structured report of the analysis of the test, for example indicating missed or erroneously connected nodes, thereby offering more objective, transparent and explainable results to the clinician. We evaluate our system with 40 elderly subjects from a geriatrics daycare clinic of a large hospital.",

        "abstract": "ProteiNN is a Transformer-based model for end-to-end single-sequence protein structure prediction, motivated by the need for accurate and efficient methods to decipher protein structures and their roles in biological processes and a system to perform prediction on user-input protein sequences. Motivation Accurate prediction of protein structures is crucial for understanding protein function, stability, and interactions, with far-reaching implications in drug discovery and protein engineering. As the fields of structural bioinformatics and artificial intelligence continue to converge, a standardized model for protein structure prediction is still yet to be seen as even large models like AlphaFold continue to change architectures. To this end, we provide a comprehensive literature review highlighting the latest advancements and challenges in deep learning-based structure prediction, as well as a benchmark system for structure prediction and visualization of amino acid protein sequences. Results We present ProteiNN, a Transformer-based model for end-to-end single-sequence protein structure prediction, motivated by the need for accurate and efficient methods to decipher protein structures and their roles in biological processes and a system to perform prediction on user-input protein sequences. The model leverages the transformer architecture\u2019s powerful representation learning capabilities to predict protein secondary and tertiary structures directly from integer-encoded amino acid sequences. Our results demonstrate that ProteiNN is effective in predicting secondary structures, though further improvements are necessary to enhance the model\u2019s performance in predicting higher-level structures. This work thus showcases the potential of transformer-based architectures in structure prediction and lays the foundation for future research in structural bioinformatics and related fields.

        "abstract": "A deep learning model is reported to predict the secondary structure content of proteins directly from primary sequences, with high computational efficiency and could be widely applied to biomedical industries, including protein biomaterial designs and regenerative medicine applications. Structural proteins are the basis of many biomaterials and key construction and functional components of all life. Further, it is well-known that the diversity of proteins' function relies on their local structures derived from their primary amino acid sequences. Here, we report a deep learning model to predict the secondary structure content of proteins directly from primary sequences, with high computational efficiency. Understanding the secondary structure content of proteins is crucial to designing proteins with targeted material functions, especially mechanical properties. Using convolutional and recurrent architectures and natural language models, our deep learning model predicts the content of two essential types of secondary structures, the \u03b1-helix and the \u03b2-sheet. The training data are collected from the Protein Data Bank and contain many existing protein geometries. We find that our model can learn the hidden features as patterns of input sequences that can then be directly related to secondary structure content. The \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet content predictions show excellent agreement with training data and newly deposited protein structures that were recently identified and that were not included in the original training set. We further demonstrate the features of the model by a search for de novo protein sequences that optimize max/min \u03b1-helix/\u03b2-sheet content and compare the predictions with folded models of these sequences based on AlphaFold2. Excellent agreement is found, underscoring that our model has predictive potential for rapidly designing proteins with specific secondary structures and could be widely applied to biomedical industries, including protein biomaterial designs and regenerative medicine applications.",

Understanding the implicit bias of training algorithms is of crucial importance in order to explain the success of overparametrised neural networks. In this paper, we study the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent over diagonal linear networks through its continuous time version, namely stochastic gradient flow. We explicitly characterise the solution chosen by the stochastic flow and prove that it always enjoys better generalisation properties than that of gradient flow. Quite surprisingly, we show that the convergence speed of the training loss controls the magnitude of the biasing effect: the slower the convergence, the better the bias. To fully complete our analysis, we provide convergence guarantees for the dynamics. We also give experimental results which support our theoretical claims. Our findings highlight the fact that structured noise can induce better generalisation and they help explain the greater performances observed in practice of stochastic gradient descent over gradient descent.",

        "abstract": "This work confirms the existence of winning tickets when the pruning process removes layers, and proposes to discover these winning tickets at initialization, eliminating the requirement of heavy computational resources for training the initial (over-parameterized) dense network. Pruning is a standard technique for reducing the computational cost of deep networks. Many advances in pruning leverage concepts from the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH). LTH reveals that inside a trained dense network exists sparse subnetworks (tickets) able to achieve similar accuracy (i.e., win the lottery - winning tickets). Pruning at initialization focuses on finding winning tickets without training a dense network. Studies on these concepts share the trend that subnetworks come from weight or filter pruning. In this work, we investigate LTH and pruning at initialization from the lens of layer pruning. First, we confirm the existence of winning tickets when the pruning process removes layers. Leveraged by this observation, we propose to discover these winning tickets at initialization, eliminating the requirement of heavy computational resources for training the initial (over-parameterized) dense network. Extensive experiments show that our winning tickets notably speed up the training phase and reduce up to 51% of carbon emission, an important step towards democratization and green Artificial Intelligence. Beyond computational benefits, our winning tickets exhibit robustness against adversarial and out-of-distribution examples. Finally, we show that our subnetworks easily win the lottery at initialization while tickets from filter removal (the standard structured LTH) hardly become winning tickets.",

        "abstract": "Sentence-level Language Modeling is introduced, a new pre-training objective for learning a discourse language representation in a fully self-supervised manner by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering. We introduce Sentence-level Language Modeling, a new pre-training objective for learning a discourse language representation in a fully self-supervised manner. Recent pre-training methods in NLP focus on learning either bottom or top-level language representations: contextualized word representations derived from language model objectives at one extreme and a whole sequence representation learned by order classification of two given textual segments at the other. However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering. Through experiments on downstream tasks such as GLUE, SQuAD, and DiscoEval, we show that this feature of our model improves the performance of the original BERT by large margins.",

        "abstract": "Reverse knowledge transfer of LL is studied in the context of naive Bayesian (NB) classification to improve the model of a previous task by leveraging future knowledge without retraining using its training data. This paper studies the problem of learning a sequence of sentiment classification tasks. The learned knowledge from each task is retained and used to help future or subsequent task learning. This learning paradigm is called Lifelong Learning (LL). However, existing LL methods either only transfer knowledge forward to help future learning and do not go back to improve the model of a previous task or require the training data of the previous task to retrain its model to exploit backward/reverse knowledge transfer. This paper studies reverse knowledge transfer of LL in the context of naive Bayesian (NB) classification. It aims to improve the model of a previous task by leveraging future knowledge without retraining using its training data. This is done by exploiting a key characteristic of the generative model of NB. That is, it is possible to improve the NB classifier for a task by improving its model parameters directly by using the retained knowledge from other tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method markedly outperforms existing LL baselines.",

        "abstract": "Human cardioids from human pluripotent stem cells that intrinsically specify, pattern and morph into chamber-like structures containing a cavity are established, serving as a foundation for future translational research. Organoids that self-organize into tissue-like structures have transformed our ability to model human development and disease. To date, all major organs can be mimicked using self-organizing organoids with the notable exception of the human heart. Here, we established self-organizing cardioids from human pluripotent stem cells that intrinsically specify, pattern and morph into chamber-like structures containing a cavity. Cardioid complexity can be controlled by signaling that instructs the separation of cardiomyocyte and endothelial layers, and by directing epicardial spreading, inward migration and differentiation. We find that cavity morphogenesis is governed by a mesodermal WNT-BMP signaling axis and requires its target HAND1, a transcription factor linked to human heart chamber cavity defects. In parallel, a WNT-VEGF axis coordinates myocardial self-organization with endothelial patterning and specification. Human cardioids represent a powerful platform to mechanistically dissect self-organization and congenital heart defects, serving as a foundation for future translational research. Highlights - Cardioids form cardiac-like chambers with inner endothelial lining and interact with epicardium - Cardioid self-organization and lineage complexity can be controlled by signaling - WNT-BMP signaling directs cavity formation in self-organized cardioids via HAND1 - WNT-VEGF coordinate endothelial patterning with myocardial cavity morphogenesis",

        "abstract": "The results reveal that semiconductor PET has superior anatomical delineation and physical performance compared with conventional scintillator PET and this improved delineation of image details makes semiconductorPET promising for clinical applications. ObjectivePET using semiconductor detectors provides high-quality images of the human brain because of its high spatial resolution. To quantitatively evaluate the delineation of image details in clinical PET images, we used normalized mutual information (NMI) to quantify the similarity with images obtained through MRI. NMI is used to evaluate image quality by determining similarity with a reference image. The aim of this study was to evaluate quantitatively the delineation of image details provided by semiconductor PET. Materials and methodsTo quantitatively evaluate anatomical delineation in clinical PET images, MRI scans of patients were used as T1-weighted images. [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET brain images were obtained from six patients using (a) a Hitachi semiconductor PET scanner and (b) a ECAT HR+ scintillator PET scanner. The NMI calculated from the semiconductor PET and MRI was denoted by NMIsemic, whereas the NMI calculated from conventional scintillator PET and MRI was denoted by NMIconve. The higher the value of NMI, the greater the similarity to MRI. ResultsNMIsemic ranged from 1.22 to 1.29, whereas NMIconve ranged from 1.13 to 1.18 (P<0.05). Furthermore, all the NMI values of the semiconductor PET were higher than those of the conventional scintillator PET. ConclusionUtilizing NMI, we quantitatively evaluated the delineation of image details in clinical PET images. The results reveal that semiconductor PET has superior anatomical delineation and physical performance compared with conventional scintillator PET. This improved delineation of image details makes semiconductor PET promising for clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes an end-to-end framework to jointly learn webly supervised detectors and reduce the negative impact of noisy labels and evaluates the proposed approach on popular benchmark datasets by training detectors on web images, which are retrieved by the corresponding category tags from photo-sharing sites. We investigate the emerging task of learning object detectors with sole image-level labels on the web without requiring any other supervision like precise annotations or additional images from well-annotated benchmark datasets. Such a task, termed as fully webly supervised object detection, is extremely challenging, since image-level labels on the web are always noisy, leading to poor performance of the learned detectors. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework to jointly learn webly supervised detectors and reduce the negative impact of noisy labels. Such noise is heterogeneous, which is further categorized into two types, namely background noise and foreground noise. Regarding the background noise, we propose a residual learning structure incorporated with weakly supervised detection, which decomposes background noise and models clean data. To explicitly learn the residual feature between clean data and noisy labels, we further propose a spatially-sensitive entropy criterion, which exploits the conditional distribution of detection results to estimate the confidence of background categories being noise. Regarding the foreground noise, a bagging-mixup learning is introduced, which suppresses foreground noisy signals from incorrectly labelled images, whilst maintaining the diversity of training data. We evaluate the proposed approach on popular benchmark datasets by training detectors on web images, which are retrieved by the corresponding category tags from photo-sharing sites. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.",

In the present research, we investigated whether people\u2019s everyday language contains sufficient signal to predict the future occurrence of mental illness. Language samples were collected from the social media website Reddit, drawing on posts to discussion groups focusing on different kinds of mental illness (clinical subreddits), as well as on posts to discussion groups focusing on nonmental health topics (nonclinical subreddits). As expected, words drawn from the clinical subreddits could be used to distinguish several kinds of mental illness (ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and depression). Interestingly, words drawn from the nonclinical subreddits (e.g., travel, cooking, cars) could also be used to distinguish different categories of mental illness, implying that the impact of mental illness spills over into topics unrelated to mental illness. Most importantly, words derived from the nonclinical subreddits predicted future postings to clinical subreddits, implying that everyday language contains signal about the likelihood of future mental illness, possibly before people are aware of their mental health condition. Finally, whereas models trained on clinical subreddits learned to focus on words indicating disorder-specific symptoms, models trained to predict future mental illness learned to focus on words indicating life stress, suggesting that kinds of features that are predictive of mental illness may change over time. Implications for the underlying causes\u00a0of\u00a0mental illness are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Efficient machine learning algorithms were assessed to evaluate the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset for dementia diagnosis and the performance of the hybrid methods between deep learning and machine learning was better than that of the deep learning models. Dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease are caused by neurodegeneration and poor communication between neurons in the brain. So far, no effective medications have been discovered for dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Thus, early diagnosis is necessary to avoid the development of these diseases. In this study, efficient machine learning algorithms were assessed to evaluate the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset for dementia diagnosis. Two CNN models (AlexNet and ResNet-50) and hybrid techniques between deep learning and machine learning (AlexNet+SVM and ResNet-50+SVM) were also evaluated for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. For the OASIS dataset, we balanced the dataset, replaced the missing values, and applied the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding algorithm (t-SNE) to represent the high-dimensional data in the low-dimensional space. All of the machine learning algorithms, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest and K Nearest Neighbours (KNN), achieved high performance for diagnosing dementia. The random forest algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 94% and precision, recall and F1 scores of 93%, 98% and 96%, respectively. The second dataset, the MRI image dataset, was evaluated by AlexNet and ResNet-50 models and AlexNet+SVM and ResNet-50+SVM hybrid techniques. All models achieved high performance, but the performance of the hybrid methods between deep learning and machine learning was better than that of the deep learning models. The AlexNet+SVM hybrid model achieved accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC scores of 94.8%, 93%, 97.75% and 99.70%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "These novel findings support the notion of increased isocortical involvement with the progression of disease, as a specific pattern in the thinning of the cortical ribbon is shown which is in agreement with the previous histological reports. Cortical thickness is a more reliable measure of atrophy than volume due to the low variability in the cytoarchitectural structure of the grey matter. However, this more desirable measure of disease-related alterations is not fully evaluated in early dementia. The study presented here is the first to report the spatial patterns of cortical thickness in the pre-clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease, namely mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Cortical thickness measurements for 34 healthy elderly, 62 MCI and 42 Alzheimer's disease subjects were made using fully automated magnetic resonance imaging-based analysis techniques in order to determine the pattern of cortical thinning as a function of disease progression. The thickness of the cortex decreased significantly when the healthy elderly brains were compared to those with MCI, mainly in the medial temporal lobe region and in some regions of the frontal and the parietal cortices. With the progression of disease from MCI to Alzheimer's disease, a general thinning of the entire cortex with significant extension into the lateral temporal lobe was found. In all cases, the results were more pronounced in the left hemisphere. In conclusion, we have shown that there is a specific pattern in the thinning of the cortical ribbon which is in agreement with the previous histological reports. These novel findings support the notion of increased isocortical involvement with the progression of disease.",

Transfer learning (TL) has been successfully applied to many real-world problems that traditional machine learning (ML) cannot handle, such as image processing, speech recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). Commonly, TL tends to address three main problems of traditional machine learning: (1) insufficient labeled data, (2) incompatible computation power, and (3) distribution mismatch. In general, TL can be organized into four categories: transductive learning, inductive learning, unsupervised learning, and negative learning. Furthermore, each category can be organized into four learning types: learning on instances, learning on features, learning on parameters, and learning on relations. This article presents a comprehensive survey on TL. In addition, this article presents the state of the art, current trends, applications, and open challenges.",

        "abstract": "The perplexity features extracted by LMs can benefit the automatic AD detection from continuous speech and show that AD patients tend to use more general, less informative, and less accurate words to describe characters and actions than healthy controls. BACKGROUND\nRecently, many studies have been carried out to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) from continuous speech by linguistic analysis and modeling. However, few of them utilize language models (LMs) to extract linguistic features and to investigate the lexical-level differences between AD and healthy speech.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nOur goals include obtaining state-of-art performance of automatic AD detection, emphasizing N-gram LMs as powerful tools for distinguishing AD patients' narratives from those of healthy controls, and discovering the differences of lexical usages between AD patients and healthy people.\n\n\nMETHOD\nWe utilize a subset of the DementiaBank corpus, including 240 control samples from 98 control participants and 256 AD samples from 194 \"PossibleAD\" or \"ProbableAD\" participants. Baseline models are built through area under curve-based feature selection and using five machine learning algorithms for comparison. Perplexity features are extracted using LMs to build enhanced detection models. Finally, the differences of lexical usages between AD patients and healthy people are investigated by a proportion test based on unigram probabilities.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur baseline model obtains a detection accuracy of 80.7% . This accuracy increases to 85.4% after integrating the perplexity features derived from LMs. Further investigations show that AD patients tend to use more general, less informative, and less accurate words to describe characters and actions than healthy controls.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe perplexity features extracted by LMs can benefit the automatic AD detection from continuous speech. There exist lexical-level differences between AD and healthy speech that can be captured by statistical N-gram LMs.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the optimal window length that can be used to accurately determine its speed and load using Convolutional and Residual Networks and trains the networks to predict the drive loads in a regression setting where the models are able to generalize well on unseen cases. Traditionally, predictive maintenance of wind turbines has relied on experts to perform time consuming feature pre-processing using statistical, time and frequency domain analysis. Recent advancements in Convolutional Neural Networks have opened the potential for using featureless approaches that learn the discriminating patterns from big data sets without expert intervention. Given multi-dimensional time series data representing sensed electric currents, in this paper we explore the optimal window length that can be used to accurately determine its speed and load using Convolutional and Residual Networks. Choosing an optimal window length is a trade-off between accuracy and number of predictions per second. Fast predictions for operating parameters are useful in maintenance strategies but they come at a cost of decreased accuracy (as there is less data available in a shorter time interval). We show how fusing multiple signals can achieve high accuracy with nine speed and load cases varying from 375rpm with 0% load to 1500rpm and 100% load. Using Class Activation Maps we investigate features in the time domain picked up by the network to make its classification decisions. Further, we train the networks to predict the drive loads in a regression setting where the models are able to generalize well on unseen cases.",

A variety of studies have demonstrated that motor disorders, parkinsonism and extrapyramidal motor symptoms (EPMS) are common in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Several studies have reported an association of EPMS with severity, progression and poor prognosis of AD. The majority of these studies used clinical assessments for the rating of EPMS. In this study, kinematic handwriting analysis was used to quantify differences in fine hand motor function in patients with probable AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI, as an assumed initial stage of AD) compared to depressed patients and healthy controls. Both patients with MCI and patients with probable AD exhibited loss of fine motor performance. Movements of AD patients were significantly less regular than those of healthy controls.",

        "abstract": "It is demonstrated how transformer models can be used to predict, directly from the primary amino acid sequence, the thermal stability of collagen triple helices, measured via the melting temperature Tm, for the prediction of specific biophysical properties of interest. Collagen is one of the most important structural proteins in biology, and its structural hierarchy plays a crucial role in many mechanically important biomaterials. Here, we demonstrate how transformer models can be used to predict, directly from the primary amino acid sequence, the thermal stability of collagen triple helices, measured via the melting temperature Tm. We report two distinct transformer architectures to compare performance. First, we train a small transformer model from scratch, using our collagen data set featuring only 633 sequence-to-Tm pairings. Second, we use a large pretrained transformer model, ProtBERT, and fine-tune it for a particular downstream task by utilizing sequence-to-Tm pairings, using a deep convolutional network to translate natural language processing BERT embeddings into required features. Both the small transformer model and the fine-tuned ProtBERT model have similar R2 values of test data (R2 = 0.84 vs 0.79, respectively), but the ProtBERT is a much larger pretrained model that may not always be applicable for other biological or biomaterials questions. Specifically, we show that the small transformer model requires only 0.026% of the number of parameters compared to the much larger model but reaches almost the same accuracy for the test set. We compare the performance of both models against 71 newly published sequences for which Tm has been obtained as a validation set and find reasonable agreement, with ProtBERT outperforming the small transformer model. The results presented here are, to our best knowledge, the first demonstration of the use of transformer models for relatively small data sets and for the prediction of specific biophysical properties of interest. We anticipate that the work presented here serves as a starting point for transformer models to be applied to other biophysical problems.",

        "abstract": "This study reveals that a specific finite-difference computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent steps, reduces the computational cost of GR and shows that the finite-Difference computation also works better in the sense of generalization performance. Gradient regularization (GR) is a method that penalizes the gradient norm of the training loss during training. While some studies have reported that GR can improve generalization performance, little attention has been paid to it from the algorithmic perspective, that is, the algorithms of GR that efficiently improve the performance. In this study, we first reveal that a specific finite-difference computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent steps, reduces the computational cost of GR. Next, we show that the finite-difference computation also works better in the sense of generalization performance. We theoretically analyze a solvable model, a diagonal linear network, and clarify that GR has a desirable implicit bias to so-called rich regime and finite-difference computation strengthens this bias. Furthermore, finite-difference GR is closely related to some other algorithms based on iterative ascent and descent steps for exploring flat minima. In particular, we reveal that the flooding method can perform finite-difference GR in an implicit way. Thus, this work broadens our understanding of GR for both practice and theory.",

        "abstract": "The underlying condition and rationale behind the winning property is investigated, and it is found that the underlying reason is largely attributed to the correlation between initialized weights and final-trained weights when the learning rate is not sufficiently large. In deep model compression, the recent finding\"Lottery Ticket Hypothesis\"(LTH) (Frankle&Carbin, 2018) pointed out that there could exist a winning ticket (i.e., a properly pruned sub-network together with original weight initialization) that can achieve competitive performance than the original dense network. However, it is not easy to observe such winning property in many scenarios, where for example, a relatively large learning rate is used even if it benefits training the original dense model. In this work, we investigate the underlying condition and rationale behind the winning property, and find that the underlying reason is largely attributed to the correlation between initialized weights and final-trained weights when the learning rate is not sufficiently large. Thus, the existence of winning property is correlated with an insufficient DNN pretraining, and is unlikely to occur for a well-trained DNN. To overcome this limitation, we propose the\"pruning&fine-tuning\"method that consistently outperforms lottery ticket sparse training under the same pruning algorithm and the same total training epochs. Extensive experiments over multiple deep models (VGG, ResNet, MobileNet-v2) on different datasets have been conducted to justify our proposals.",

        "abstract": "This work extends BERT-style models with bottom-up and top-down computation to predict future sentences in latent space at each intermediate layer in the networks to improve sentence-level representations of pre-trained models by borrowing ideas from predictive coding theory. Learning sentence representations is an essential and challenging topic in the deep learning and natural language processing communities. Recent methods pre-train big models on a massive text corpus, focusing mainly on learning the representation of contextualized words. As a result, these models cannot generate informative sentence embeddings since they do not explicitly exploit the structure and discourse relationships existing in contiguous sentences. Drawing inspiration from human language processing, this work explores how to improve sentence-level representations of pre-trained models by borrowing ideas from predictive coding theory. Specifically, we extend BERT-style models with bottom-up and top-down computation to predict future sentences in latent space at each intermediate layer in the networks. We conduct extensive experimentation with various benchmarks for the English and Spanish languages, designed to assess sentence- and discourse-level representations and pragmatics-focused assessments. Our results show that our approach improves sentence representations consistently for both languages. Furthermore, the experiments also indicate that our models capture discourse and pragmatics knowledge. In addition, to validate the proposed method, we carried out an ablation study and a qualitative study with which we verified that the predictive mechanism helps to improve the quality of the representations.",

This paper studies sentiment classification in the lifelong learning setting that incrementally learns a sequence of sentiment classification tasks. It proposes a new lifelong learning model (called L2PG) that can retain and selectively transfer the knowledge learned in the past to help learn the new task. A key innovation of this proposed model is a novel parameter-gate (p-gate) mechanism that regulates the flow or transfer of the previously learned knowledge to the new task. Specifically, it can selectively use the network parameters (which represent the retained knowledge gained from the previous tasks) to assist the learning of the new task t. Knowledge distillation is also employed in the process to preserve the past knowledge by approximating the network output at the state when task t-1 was learned. Experimental results show that L2PG outperforms strong baselines, including even multiple task learning.",

        "abstract": "A novel way to generically implement any neural network algorithm on a FPGA is suggested and shows a radical improvement in power consumption and improvement in the time taken to perform the same task. Neural networks are traditionally deployed on processor based systems. These systems suffer two major problems in terms of power consumption and time lag due to serial operation of processors. One of the major drawbacks introduced by these issues is the remote deployment of AI system. This paper addresses both issues and suggest a novel way to generically implement any neural network algorithm on a FPGA. The proposed method is tested and evaluated on Xilinx\u00ae Kintex\u00ae-7 for Radial basis function neural network with one input layer, one hidden layer and one output layer. Analysis shows a radical improvement in power consumption and improvement in the time taken to perform the same task. Actual implementation is performed in Xilinx\u00ae Vivado\u00ae software using Vivado HLS\u00ae widely used by professionals for quick implementation in the industry.",

The paper presents the design of Neural Network that performs encryption and decryption processes of symmetric key cipher properties. The target from the network has been selected to match the output of the Advanced Encryption Standard AES that have an efficient and recommended security. Computer simulation results of the proposed NN cryptosystem show the closeness of the results achieved by the proposed NN-based AES cryptosystem with that of the conventional AES. For high speed and high efficiency implementation, Field Programmable Gated Array (FPGA) has been selected. The neural network had been implemented using the technique of pipelining to reduce the connection between the neurons. The final hardware had been implemented through programming the Xilinx XCVirtex \u2013E Family, with a data bus of 128 bits, maximum clock frequency of 500MHz and throughput of 4Gbps for one neural network. The tool which used in the implementation of the system is the Foundation ISE 3.1i.",

Stem-cell derived in vitro cardiac models have provided profound insights into mechanisms in cardiac development and disease. Efficient differentiation of specific cardiac cell types from human pluripotent stem cells using a three-step Wnt signaling modulation has been one of the major discoveries that has enabled personalized cardiovascular disease modeling approaches. Generation of cardiac cell types follow key development stages during embryogenesis, they intuitively are excellent models to study cardiac tissue patterning in primitive cardiac structures. Here, we provide a brief overview of protocols that have laid the foundation for derivation of stem-cell derived three-dimensional cardiac models. Further this article highlights features and utility of the models to distinguish the advantages and trade-offs in modeling embryonic development and disease processes. Finally, we discuss the challenges in improving robustness in the current models and utilizing developmental principles to bring higher physiological relevance. In vitro human cardiac models are complimentary tools that allow mechanistic interrogation in a reductionist way. The unique advantage of utilizing patient specific stem cells and continued improvements in generating reliable organoid mimics of the heart will boost predictive power of these tools in basic and translational research.",

        "abstract": "The results demonstrate that subvoxel accuracy with respect to the stereotactic reference solution can be achieved completely automatically and without any prior segmentation, feature extraction, or other preprocessing steps which makes this method very well suited for clinical applications. A new approach to the problem of multimodality medical image registration is proposed, using a basic concept from information theory, mutual information (MI), or relative entropy, as a new matching criterion. The method presented in this paper applies MI to measure the statistical dependence or information redundancy between the image intensities of corresponding voxels in both images, which is assumed to be maximal if the images are geometrically aligned. Maximization of MI is a very general and powerful criterion, because no assumptions are made regarding the nature of this dependence and no limiting constraints are imposed on the image content of the modalities involved. The accuracy of the MI criterion is validated for rigid body registration of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and photon emission tomography (PET) images by comparison with the stereotactic registration solution, while robustness is evaluated with respect to implementation issues, such as interpolation and optimization, and image content, including partial overlap and image degradation. Our results demonstrate that subvoxel accuracy with respect to the stereotactic reference solution can be achieved completely automatically and without any prior segmentation, feature extraction, or other preprocessing steps which makes this method very well suited for clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "Anxiety and depression are mood disorders which negatively impact many people. Psychology studies suggest depression is associated with future time horizons, or how \"far\" into the future people tend to think, and anxiety is associated with temporal discounting, or how much people devalue delayed future rewards. Separate studies from linguistics and economics have shown that individual differences in how people refer to future time predict temporal discounting. Yet no one\u2014that we know of\u2014has investigated whether future time reference habits are a marker of anxiety and/or depression. In Study 1, we analysed data from the social media website Reddit to test for relationships between these variables. Users who had previously posted popular contributions to forums dedicated to anxiety and depression referenced the future and the past more often than controls, had more proximal future and past time horizons, and significantly differed in their linguistic future time reference patterns. They used fewer future tense constructions (e.g. will), fewer high-certainty constructions (e.g. certainly), more low-certainty constructions (e.g. could), more bouletic modal constructions (e.g. hope), and more deontic modal constructions (e.g. must). This motivated Study 2, a survey-based mediation analysis. Self-reported anxious participants represented future events as more temporally distal and therefore temporally discounted to a greater degree. The same was not true of depression. We contextualise the results using two theoretical frameworks: construal level theory and functionalist approaches to clinical psychology. We conclude that methods which combine big-data with experimental paradigms can help identify novel markers of mental illness, which can aid in the development of new therapies and diagnostic criteria.",

        "abstract": "The results indicate that the proposed Cascade VGGCOV19-NET architecture was highly successful in detecting COVID-19 and contributes to the literature in terms of both YOLO-aided deep architecture and classification success. X-ray images are an easily accessible, fast, and inexpensive method of diagnosing COVID-19, widely used in health centers around the world. In places where there is a shortage of specialist doctors and radiologists, there is need for a system that can direct patients to advanced health centers by pre-diagnosing COVID-19 from X-ray images. Also, smart computer-aided systems that automatically detect COVID-19 positive cases will support daily clinical applications. The study aimed to classify COVID-19 via X-ray images in high precision ratios with pre-trained VGG19 deep CNN architecture and the YOLOv3 detection algorithm. For this purpose, VGG19, VGGCOV19-NET models, and the original Cascade models were created by feeding these models with the YOLOv3 algorithm. Cascade models are the original models fed with the lung zone X-ray images detected with the YOLOv3 algorithm. Model performances were evaluated using fivefold cross-validation according to recall, specificity, precision, f1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC analysis performance metrics. While the accuracy of the Cascade VGGCOV19-NET model was 99.84% for the binary class (COVID vs. no-findings) data set, it was 97.16% for the three-class (COVID vs. no-findings vs. pneumonia) data set. The Cascade VGGCOV19-NET model has a higher classification performance than VGG19, Cascade VGG19, VGGCOV19-NET and previous studies. Feeding the CNN models with the YOLOv3 detection algorithm decreases the training test time while increasing the classification performance. The results indicate that the proposed Cascade VGGCOV19-NET architecture was highly successful in detecting COVID-19. Therefore, this study contributes to the literature in terms of both YOLO-aided deep architecture and classification success.",

        "abstract": "The Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database of AD patients was used to develop a deep learning approach for AD identification and the results show that the deep learners offered are more effective than other systems already in use. On a global scale, one of the prevalent causes of dementia is Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). It will cause a steady deterioration in the individual from the mild stage to the severe stage, and thus impair their capacity to finish any tasks with no aid. The diagnosis is done with the utilization of existing methods which include medical history; neuropsychological testing as well as MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), a lack of sensitivity as well as precision does affect the consistency of efficient procedures. With the deep learning network\u2019s utilization, it is possible to create a framework for detecting specific AD characteristics from the MRI images. While automatic diagnosis is done with the application of diverse machine learning techniques, the existing ones do suffer from certain constraints with regards to accuracy. Thus, this work\u2019s key goal is to increase the classification\u2019s accuracy through the inclusion of a pre-processing approach prior to the deep learning model. The Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database of AD patients was used to develop a deep learning approach for AD identification. In addition, this study will present ideas for Haralick features, feature extraction from Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-19 network techniques. The results of the experiments show that the deep learners offered are more effective than other systems already in use.",

SUMMARY\u00a0Neuroimaging has assumed an active role in the diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and other dementias. Structural MRI can estimate changes in specific brain structures relative to normal and pathological aging such as volume, cortical thickness and gray matter density. Several different structural MRI methods can be used to identify neuropathology and point to an early atrophy in medial temporal lobe structures in patients with AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment, especially in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. These alterations in medial temporal lobe structures were also considered evidence for neurodegeneration, even in preclinical AD. However, evaluation in other areas such as ventricular enlargement and precuneus may help the diagnosis, even in the early stages of the disease. Currently, neuroimaging is an excellent tool for increasing diagnostic accuracy, but does not substitute a careful clinical and neuropsychological evaluation.

        "abstract": "An approach is proposed to transfer learnt features from the embedding layers present commonly in deep neural networks for structured data along with a format for effective portability of these trained embeddings. Structured data is a widely used type of data with numerous applications in training machine learning models. However, training deep learning models require a lot of data, which may not be present for all use-cases. In addition to this, training these models could get very expensive as the data increases. Transfer learning can be a solution to these problems. It involves reusing features from trained models on the same or similar tasks, however, it has not been explored much for structured data yet. In this paper, an approach is proposed to transfer learnt features from the embedding layers present commonly in deep neural networks for structured data along with a format for effective portability of these trained embeddings. Experimentally, it is observed that the proposed method resulted in faster training and the model parameters start at a better point compared to parameters of a randomly initialized model, resulting in lesser training costs as well.",

        "abstract": "The Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech task offers acoustically pre-processed and balanced datasets for the classification and prediction of AD and associated phenotypes through the modelling of spontaneous speech. Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) is an incurable, debilitating, and progressive neurodegenerative condition that affects cognitive function. Early diagnosis is important as therapeutics can delay progression and give those diagnosed vital time. Developing models that analyse spontaneous speech could eventually provide an efficient diagnostic modality for earlier diagnosis of AD. The Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech task offers acoustically pre-processed and balanced datasets for the classification and prediction of AD and associated phenotypes through the modelling of spontaneous speech. We exclusively analyse the supplied textual transcripts of the spontaneous speech dataset, building and comparing performance across numerous models for the classification of AD vs controls and the prediction of Mental Mini State Exam scores. We rigorously train and evaluate Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) alongside deep learning Transformer based models. We find our top performing models to be a simple Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectoriser as input into a SVM model and a pre-trained Transformer based model `DistilBERT' when used as an embedding layer into simple linear models. We demonstrate test set scores of 0.81-0.82 across classification metrics and a RMSE of 4.58.",

        "abstract": "This study tried to understand information processes with bidirected functional connectivity and explored both feedforward and feedback information flow in the brain regions to gain a better understanding of how information is shared and communicated from an information-theoretical perspective with directed information. Perception processing in the human brain is medi-ated by functional connectivity among brain areas. To a certain extent, functional connectivity builds a communication channel among brain regions and even supports our perception and consciousness functions. However, the flow of information doesn't always go in the same direction between different parts of the brain, and it also uses bidirectional exchanges of information. The role of bidirected functional connectivity in the brain is still not well explored so far. More narrowly, we want to know how bidirectional communication regions in the different brain areas help with information processing. To do this, we used directed information to quantify information exchange from simulation neural signals and real neural data that includes each part of the visual cortex region, and it showed that directed information can discover causal effects in both simulation and real experiments. All in all, in this study, we tried to understand information processes with bidirected functional connectivity and explored both feedforward and feedback information flow in the brain regions. On the one hand, we discovered feedback functional connectivity between visual regions, such as LRSC, LLOC, LOPA, and RPPA. Biologically speaking, this makes sense because natural images, such as objects, places, or more complex images, are typically represented in high-level visual regions. On the other hand, we also found that there is information flow between the scene-selective areas, e.g., OPA, PPA, RSC, and object-selective regions, e.g., LOC. As a result, we can gain a better understanding of how information is shared and communicated from an information-theoretical perspective with directed information.",

        "abstract": "This work explored abnormal network components using NBS based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)connectivity in a sample of patients with AD, MCI and age-matched healthy subjects to deepen the understanding of the neural basis of AD/MCI dysfunction. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been associated with impaired communication among large-scale brain networks. Given nature that interconnected subnetworks are responsible for daily behavior than a single pair of functional connectivity, it is valid to use a network-based statistic (NBS) method to exploit the clustering structure of connectivity alterations in AD/MCI. We explored abnormal network components using NBS based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)connectivity in a sample of patients with AD (N = 35), MCI (N = 27) and age-matched healthy subjects (N = 27). The results demonstrated that patients had reduced functional connectivity strength in several components, including the default mode network, sensorimotor network, visual-sensory network, and visual-attention network. In patients with AD, the functional connectivity of these components of interest (COIs) exhibited greater attenuation than that in MCI subjects compared with normal cognition. A greater degree of cognitive impairment was correlated with a greater decrease in functional connectivity in the identified COIs. These results indicate that the neurodegenerative disruption of fMRI connectivity is widely distributed in several networks in AD/MCI. These profiles deepen our understanding of the neural basis of AD/MCI dysfunction and indicate the potential of resting-state fMRI measures as biomarkers or predictors of AD.",

        "abstract": "The kinematic features of writing and drawing procedures, rather than the final product, may be a useful and objective complement to the clinical assessment of patients with cognitive impairment. Background: Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative dementia of old age, and the leading chronic disease contributor to disability and dependence among older people worldwide. Clinically, AD is characterized by a progressive cognitive decline that interferes with the abil-ity to perform the activities of daily living. Handwriting and drawing are complex human activities that entail an intricate blend of cognitive, kinesthetic, and perceptual-motor features. Objective: To compare the kinematic characteristics of handwriting and drawing between patients with AD, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls. Methods: We used a cross-sectional and observational design to assess the kinematic and pressure fea-tures of handwriting and drawing using a computerized system. Participants were asked to copy one sen-tence, write a dictated sentence and an own sentence, copy two and-three dimensions drawings, and to execute the clock drawing test. By means of discriminant analyses, we explored the value of several kin-ematic features in order to classify participants depending on their degree of cognitive functioning. Results: The sample consisted of 52 participants (23 AD, 12 MCI, and 17 healthy controls) with a mean age of 69.7 years (SD=8.11). The degree of correct classification was largely dependent on the nature of the groups to be classified and the specific task, and ranged between 63.5% and 100%. Diagnostic accu-racy based on kinematic measures showed higher specificity values for distinguishing between normal and impaired cognition (MCI and AD), and higher sensitivity was obtained when distinguishing between impaired cognition levels (MCI vs. AD). Conclusion: The kinematic features of writing and drawing procedures, rather than the final product, may be a useful and objective complement to the clinical assessment of patients with cognitive impairment.",

        "abstract": "This work introduces a novel, effective procedure for simultaneously minimizing loss value and loss sharpness, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which improves model generalization across a variety of benchmark datasets and models, yielding novel state-of-the-art performance for several. In today's heavily overparameterized models, the value of the training loss provides few guarantees on model generalization ability. Indeed, optimizing only the training loss value, as is commonly done, can easily lead to suboptimal model quality. Motivated by the connection between geometry of the loss landscape and generalization---including a generalization bound that we prove here---we introduce a novel, effective procedure for instead simultaneously minimizing loss value and loss sharpness. In particular, our procedure, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), seeks parameters that lie in neighborhoods having uniformly low loss; this formulation results in a min-max optimization problem on which gradient descent can be performed efficiently. We present empirical results showing that SAM improves model generalization across a variety of benchmark datasets (e.g., CIFAR-{10, 100}, ImageNet, finetuning tasks) and models, yielding novel state-of-the-art performance for several. Additionally, we find that SAM natively provides robustness to label noise on par with that provided by state-of-the-art procedures that specifically target learning with noisy labels.",

        "abstract": "It is shown that a depth $L+1$ network is sufficient and this result indicates that the authors can expect to find lottery tickets at realistic, commonly used depths while only requiring logarithmic overparametrization. The strong lottery ticket hypothesis has highlighted the potential for training deep neural networks by pruning, which has inspired interesting practical and theoretical insights into how neural networks can represent functions. For networks with ReLU activation functions, it has been proven that a target network with depth $L$ can be approximated by the subnetwork of a randomly initialized neural network that has double the target's depth $2L$ and is wider by a logarithmic factor. We show that a depth $L+1$ network is sufficient. This result indicates that we can expect to find lottery tickets at realistic, commonly used depths while only requiring logarithmic overparametrization. Our novel construction approach applies to a large class of activation functions and is not limited to ReLUs.",

        "abstract": "XLNet is proposed, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autore progressive formulation. With the capability of modeling bidirectional contexts, denoising autoencoding based pretraining like BERT achieves better performance than pretraining approaches based on autoregressive language modeling. However, relying on corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.",

        "abstract": "A novel model called CTR is proposed to solve the problems of overcoming catastrophic forgetting and encouraging knowledge transfer across tasks in continuous learning, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CTR. Continual learning (CL) learns a sequence of tasks incrementally with the goal of achieving two main objectives: overcoming catastrophic forgetting (CF) and encouraging knowledge transfer (KT) across tasks. However, most existing techniques focus only on overcoming CF and have no mechanism to encourage KT, and thus do not do well in KT. Although several papers have tried to deal with both CF and KT, our experiments show that they suffer from serious CF when the tasks do not have much shared knowledge. Another observation is that most current CL methods do not use pre-trained models, but it has been shown that such models can significantly improve the end task performance. For example, in natural language processing, fine-tuning a BERT-like pre-trained language model is one of the most effective approaches. However, for CL, this approach suffers from serious CF. An interesting question is how to make the best use of pre-trained models for CL. This paper proposes a novel model called CTR to solve these problems. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CTR.2",

        "abstract": "The proposed FormerTime, an hierarchical representation model for improving the classification capacity for the MTSC task, employs a hierarchical network architecture to perform multi-scale feature maps and exhibits three aspects of merits: inheriting the strength of both transformers and convolutional networks, and tacking the efficiency challenges incurred by the self-attention mechanism. Deep learning-based algorithms, e.g., convolutional networks, have significantly facilitated multivariate time series classification (MTSC) task. Nevertheless, they suffer from the limitation in modeling long-range dependence due to the nature of convolution operations. Recent advancements have shown the potential of transformers to capture long-range dependence. However, it would incur severe issues, such as fixed scale representations, temporal-invariant and quadratic time complexity, with transformers directly applicable to the MTSC task because of the distinct properties of time series data. To tackle these issues, we propose FormerTime, an hierarchical representation model for improving the classification capacity for the MTSC task. In the proposed FormerTime, we employ a hierarchical network architecture to perform multi-scale feature maps. Besides, a novel transformer encoder is further designed, in which an efficient temporal reduction attention layer and a well-informed contextual positional encoding generating strategy are developed. To sum up, FormerTime exhibits three aspects of merits: (1) learning hierarchical multi-scale representations from time series data, (2) inheriting the strength of both transformers and convolutional networks, and (3) tacking the efficiency challenges incurred by the self-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments performed on 10 publicly available datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the FormerTime compared to previous competitive baselines.",

        "abstract": "An iPSC-derived multi-lineage human heart organoid (hHO) platform composed of different cardiac cell types is leveraged to set the basis of a preclinical model for evaluating drug cardiotoxicity and assessing cardiac fibrosis phenotypes, and the inhibition of the p38-MAPK pathway significantly reduces COL1A1 depositions. Cardiac reactive fibrosis is a fibroblast-derived maladaptive process to tissue injury that exacerbates an uncontrolled deposition of large amounts of extracellular matrix (ECM) around cardiomyocytes and vascular cells, being recognized as a pathological entity of morbidity and mortality. Cardiac fibrosis is partially controlled through the sustained activation of TGF-\u03b21 through IL-11 in fibroblasts. Yet, preclinical studies on fibrosis treatment require human physiological approaches due to the multicellular crosstalk between cells and tissues in the heart. Here, we leveraged an iPSC-derived multi-lineage human heart organoid (hHO) platform composed of different cardiac cell types to set the basis of a preclinical model for evaluating drug cardiotoxicity and assessing cardiac fibrosis phenotypes. We found that the inhibition of the p38-MAPK pathway significantly reduces COL1A1 depositions. Yet, concomitant treatment with organ-rejection immunosuppressant drugs Tacrolimus or Sirolimus reverts this effect, opening new questions on the clinical considerations of combined therapies in reducing fibrosis after organ transplantation.",

        "abstract": "Results indicate that the combined measures yield a better registration function does mutual information or normalized mutual information per se, and the registration functions are less sensitive to low sampling resolution, do not contain incorrect global maxima that are sometimes found in the mutual information function, and interpolation-induced local minima can be reduced. Mutual information has developed into an accurate measure for rigid and affine monomodality and multimodality image registration. The robustness of the measure is questionable, however. A possible reason for this is the absence of spatial information in the measure. The present paper proposes to include spatial information by combining mutual information with a term based on the image gradient of the images to be registered. The gradient term not only seeks to align locations of high gradient magnitude, but also aims for a similar orientation of the gradients at these locations. Results of combining both standard mutual information as well as a normalized measure are presented for rigid registration of three-dimensional clinical images [magnetic resonance (MR), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET)]. The results indicate that the combined measures yield a better registration function does mutual information or normalized mutual information per se. The registration functions are less sensitive to low sampling resolution, do not contain incorrect global maxima that are sometimes found in the mutual information function, and interpolation-induced local minima can be reduced. These characteristics yield the promise of more robust registration measures. The accuracy of the combined measures is similar to that of mutual information-based methods.",

        "abstract": "This position paper examines the most pervasive human-grounded concept in XAI evaluation, explanation plausibility, and argues against this idea, and shows how optimizing and evaluating XAI for plausibility is sometimes harmful, and always ineffective in achieving model understandability, transparency, and trustworthiness. Setting proper evaluation objectives for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is vital for making XAI algorithms follow human communication norms, support human reasoning processes, and fulfill human needs for AI explanations. In this position paper, we examine the most pervasive human-grounded concept in XAI evaluation, explanation plausibility. Plausibility measures how reasonable the machine explanation is compared to the human explanation. Plausibility has been conventionally formulated as an important evaluation objective for AI explainability tasks. We argue against this idea, and show how optimizing and evaluating XAI for plausibility is sometimes harmful, and always ineffective in achieving model understandability, transparency, and trustworthiness. Specifically, evaluating XAI algorithms for plausibility regularizes the machine explanation to express exactly the same content as human explanation, which deviates from the fundamental motivation for humans to explain: expressing similar or alternative reasoning trajectories while conforming to understandable forms or language. Optimizing XAI for plausibility regardless of the model decision correctness also jeopardizes model trustworthiness, because doing so breaks an important assumption in human-human explanation that plausible explanations typically imply correct decisions, and vice versa; and violating this assumption eventually leads to either undertrust or overtrust of AI models. Instead of being the end goal in XAI evaluation, plausibility can serve as an intermediate computational proxy for the human process of interpreting explanations to optimize the utility of XAI. We further highlight the importance of explainability-specific evaluation objectives by differentiating the AI explanation task from the object localization task.",

        "abstract": "The results suggest that individuals who think far into the future make a variety of future-oriented decisions, such as investing in the future and avoiding future harms, and suggest that future thinking may affect decisions by making the future seem more connected to the present. Significance The way that people think about the future can affect their decisions. Our results suggest that individuals who think far into the future make a variety of future-oriented decisions, such as investing in the future and avoiding future harms. Our results also suggest that future thinking may affect decisions by making the future seem more connected to the present. More broadly, our results show the viability of using automated analysis of social media text to measure psychological constructs. Automated analyses of social media are naturalistic (increasing sensitivity to a range of future events), unsolicited (reducing the effects of experimenter prompting), and scalable to millions of tweets generated by tens of thousands of individuals. We use big data methods to investigate how decision-making might depend on future sightedness (that is, on how far into the future people\u2019s thoughts about the future extend). In study 1, we establish a link between future thinking and decision-making at the population level in showing that US states with citizens having relatively far future sightedness, as reflected in their tweets, take fewer risks than citizens in states having relatively near future sightedness. In study 2, we analyze people\u2019s tweets to confirm a connection between future sightedness and decision-making at the individual level in showing that people with long future sightedness are more likely to choose larger future rewards over smaller immediate rewards. In study 3, we show that risk taking decreases with increases in future sightedness as reflected in people\u2019s tweets. The ability of future sightedness to predict decisions suggests that future sightedness is a relatively stable cognitive characteristic. This implication was supported in an analysis of tweets by over 38,000 people that showed that future sightedness has both state and trait characteristics (study 4). In study 5, we provide evidence for a potential mechanism by which future sightedness can affect decisions in showing that far future sightedness can make the future seem more connected to the present, as reflected in how people refer to the present, past, and future in their tweets over the course of several minutes. Our studies show how big data methods can be applied to naturalistic data to reveal underlying psychological properties and processes.",

        "abstract": "The results of this study indicate that the Resnet50 model is the best model that produces the highest accuracy compared to other models and has a good performance for detection of COVID-19 based on Chest X-Ray. The transmission of cases of the COVID-19 virus (Coronavirus disease) is currently still racing. Even though the COVID-19 recovery rate has increased, new variants such as Omicron or Centaurus are still spreading in various countries. Detection COVID-19 based on Chest X-Ray is needed to avoid the wider transmission of the virus. This study uses the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) transfer learning models like AlexNet, VGG19, Resnet50, InceptionV3 and the BasicCNN model. This study uses a dataset named the COVID-19 Radiography Database which contains three classes, namely COVID-19, Normal, and Viral Pneumonia. The results of this study indicate that the Resnet50 model is the best model that produces the highest accuracy compared to other models. The Resnet50 model obtained an accuracy of 98.68%. Then followed by other models in sequence, namely InceptionV3, VGG19, AlexNet, and BasicCNN. Evaluation in this study also uses Precision, Recall, and F1-Measure which show that Resnet50 obtains the highest value compared with other methods. This shows that the transfer learning model has a good performance for detection of COVID-19 based on Chest X-Ray.",

        "title": "A Deep Learning approach for Diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment Based on MRI Images",
        "abstract": "A deep learning approach is used to discriminate between healthy people and the two types of MCI groups based on MRI results, using the convolutional neural network with an efficient architecture to extract high-quality features from MRIs to classify people into healthy, EMCI, or LMCI groups. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediary stage condition between healthy people and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) patients and other dementias. AD is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder, which is a significant threat to people, age 65 and older. Although MCI does not always lead to AD, an early diagnosis at the stage of MCI can be very helpful in identifying people who are at risk of AD. Moreover, the early diagnosis of MCI can lead to more effective treatment, or at least, significantly delay the disease\u2019s progress, and can lead to social and financial benefits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which has become a significant tool for the diagnosis of MCI and AD, can provide neuropsychological data for analyzing the variance in brain structure and function. MCI is divided into early and late MCI (EMCI and LMCI) and sadly, there is no clear differentiation between the brain structure of healthy people and MCI patients, especially in the EMCI stage. This paper aims to use a deep learning approach, which is one of the most powerful branches of machine learning, to discriminate between healthy people and the two types of MCI groups based on MRI results. The convolutional neural network (CNN) with an efficient architecture was used to extract high-quality features from MRIs to classify people into healthy, EMCI, or LMCI groups. The MRIs of 600 individuals used in this study included 200 control normal (CN) people, 200 EMCI patients, and 200 LMCI patients. This study randomly selected 70 percent of the data to train our model and 30 percent for the test set. The results showed the best overall classification between CN and LMCI groups in the sagittal view with an accuracy of 94.54 percent. In addition, 93.96 percent and 93.00 percent accuracy were reached for the pairs of EMCI/LMCI and CN/EMCI, respectively.",

The purpose of this study was to assess whether structural brain damage as detected by volumetric magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) is present in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and, if so, whether these abnormalities are global in character or restricted to the temporal lobe. Volumetric MTI analysis of the whole brain and temporal and frontal lobes was performed in 25 patients with probable AD, in 13 patients with MCI, and in 28 controls. Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) histograms were produced, from which we derived measures for structural brain damage and atrophy. The peak heights of the MTR histograms of MCI and AD patients were lower than those of controls for the whole brain and temporal and frontal lobes, reflecting structural brain damage. AD patients had more atrophy than controls in all regions that were studied. MCI patients differed from controls for temporal lobe atrophy only. Volumetric MTI demonstrates structural changes that are related to cognitive decline in large parts of the brain of AD patients. Moreover, structural changes also were observed in MCI patients, indicating that widespread brain damage can be demonstrated before patients are clinically demented.",

One desired capability for machines is the ability to transfer their knowledge of one domain to another where data is (usually) scarce. Despite ample adaptation of transfer learning in various deep learning applications, we yet do not understand what enables a successful transfer and which part of the network is responsible for that. In this paper, we provide new tools and analyses to address these fundamental questions. Through a series of analyses on transferring to block-shuffled images, we separate the effect of feature reuse from learning low-level statistics of data and show that some benefit of transfer learning comes from the latter. We present that when training from pre-trained weights, the model stays in the same basin in the loss landscape and different instances of such model are similar in feature space and close in parameter space.",

        "abstract": "The promise of using machine learning for detecting cognitive decline from speech in AD patients is demonstrated by methods for learning models using speech samples from the DementiaBank database, for identifying which subjects have Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. Alzheimer\u2019s dementia (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative illness that manifests in a gradual decline of cognitive function. Early identification of AD is essential for managing the ensuing cognitive deficits, which may lead to a better prognostic outcome. Speech data can serve as a window into cognitive functioning and can be used to screen for early signs of AD. This paper describes methods for learning models using speech samples from the DementiaBank database, for identifying which subjects have Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. We consider two machine learning tasks: 1) binary classification to distinguish patients from healthy controls, and 2) regression to estimate each subject\u2019s Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. To develop models that can use acoustic and/or language features, we explore a variety of dimension reduction techniques, training algorithms, and fusion strategies. Our best performing classification model, using language features with dimension reduction and regularized logistic regression, achieves an accuracy of 85.4% on a held-out test set. On the regression task, a linear regression model trained on a reduced set of language features achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.62 on the test set. These results demonstrate the promise of using machine learning for detecting cognitive decline from speech in AD patients.",

        "abstract": "It is concluded that people with schizophrenia tend to have a less strongly integrated, more diverse profile of brain functional connectivity, associated with a less hub-dominated configuration of complex brain functional networks. Schizophrenia has often been conceived as a disorder of connectivity between components of large-scale brain networks. We tested this hypothesis by measuring aspects of both functional connectivity and functional network topology derived from resting-state fMRI time series acquired at 72 cerebral regions over 17 min from 15 healthy volunteers (14 male, 1 female) and 12 people diagnosed with schizophrenia (10 male, 2 female). We investigated between-group differences in strength and diversity of functional connectivity in the 0.06\u20130.125 Hz frequency interval, and some topological properties of undirected graphs constructed from thresholded interregional correlation matrices. In people with schizophrenia, strength of functional connectivity was significantly decreased, whereas diversity of functional connections was increased. Topologically, functional brain networks had reduced clustering and small-worldness, reduced probability of high-degree hubs, and increased robustness in the schizophrenic group. Reduced degree and clustering were locally significant in medial parietal, premotor and cingulate, and right orbitofrontal cortical nodes of functional networks in schizophrenia. Functional connectivity and topological metrics were correlated with each other and with behavioral performance on a verbal fluency task. We conclude that people with schizophrenia tend to have a less strongly integrated, more diverse profile of brain functional connectivity, associated with a less hub-dominated configuration of complex brain functional networks. Alongside these behaviorally disadvantageous differences, however, brain networks in the schizophrenic group also showed a greater robustness to random attack, pointing to a possible benefit of the schizophrenia connectome, if less extremely expressed.",

        "abstract": "This study comprehensively characterize AD\u2010associated functional brain alterations using one of the world's largest resting\u2010state functional MRI (fMRI) biobank for the disorder and highlights the potential for a reproducible and generalizable functional brain imaging biomarker to aid the early diagnosis of AD and track its progression. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with disruptions in brain activity and networks. However, there is substantial inconsistency among studies that have investigated functional brain alterations in AD; such contradictions have hindered efforts to elucidate the core disease mechanisms. In this study, we aim to comprehensively characterize AD\u2010associated functional brain alterations using one of the world's largest resting\u2010state functional MRI (fMRI) biobank for the disorder. The biobank includes fMRI data from six neuroimaging centers, with a total of 252\u2009AD patients, 221 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and 215 healthy comparison individuals. Meta\u2010analytic techniques were used to unveil reliable differences in brain function among the three groups. Relative to the healthy comparison group, AD was associated with significantly reduced functional connectivity and local activity in the default\u2010mode network, basal ganglia and cingulate gyrus, along with increased connectivity or local activity in the prefrontal lobe and hippocampus (p\u2009<\u2009.05, Bonferroni corrected). Moreover, these functional alterations were significantly correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment (AD and MCI groups) and amyloid\u2010\u03b2 burden. Machine learning models were trained to recognize key fMRI features to predict individual diagnostic status and clinical score. Leave\u2010one\u2010site\u2010out cross\u2010validation established that diagnostic status (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.85) and clinical score (mean correlation coefficient between predicted and actual Mini\u2010Mental State Examination scores: 0.56, p\u2009<\u2009.0001) could be predicted with high accuracy. Collectively, our findings highlight the potential for a reproducible and generalizable functional brain imaging biomarker to aid the early diagnosis of AD and track its progression.",

        "abstract": "The development of each country depends on electricity. In this regard, conventional energy sources, e.g., diesel, petrol, etc., are decaying. Consequently, the investigations of renewable energy sources (RES) are increasing as alternate energy sources for the fulfillment of energy requirements. The output characteristics of RES are becoming non-linear. Therefore, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques are critical for extracting the maximum power point (MPP) from RES, e.g., photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbines (WT). RES such as the Fuel Cell (FC) has been hailed as one of the major capable RES for automobile applications since they continually create electricity for the dc-link (even if one or both RES are not supplied by solar and wind, the FC will continue to supply to the load). Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (AN-FIS) MPPT for PV, WT, FC, and Hybrid RES is employed in this research article to solve this problem. The high step-ups (boost converters) are connected with PV and FC modules, and the buck converter is connected with the WT framework, to extract the maximum amount of power using MPPT algorithms. The performance of proposed frameworks based on MPPT algorithms is assessed in variable operating conditions such as Solar-Radiation (SR), Wind-Speed (WS), and Hydrogen-Fuel-Rate (HFR). A novel AN-FIS MPPT framework has enhanced the power of Hybrid RES at DC-link, and also reduced the simulation time to reach the MPP when compared to the perturb and observe (P-&-O), Fuzzy-Logic Controller (F-LC), and artificial neural network (AN-N) MPPTs.",

BACKGROUND\nAgraphia is a typical feature in the clinical course of Alzheimer's disease (AD).\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nAssess the differences between AD and normal aging as regards kinematographic features of handwriting and elucidate writing deficits in AD.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe study included 23 patients with AD (78.09 years/SD\u200a=\u200a7.12; MMSE 21.39/SD\u200a=\u200a3.61) and 34 healthy controls (75.56 years/SD\u200a=\u200a5.85; MMSE 29.06/SD\u200a=\u200a0.78). Both groups performed alphabetical and non-alphabetical writing tasks. The kinematographic assessment included the average number of inversions per stroke (NIV; number of peaks in the velocity profile in a single up or down stroke), percentage of automated segments, frequency (average number of strokes per second), writing pressure, and writing velocity on paper.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 14 patients showed overt writing difficulties reflected by omissions or substitutions of letters. AD patients showed less automated movements (as measured by NIV), lower writing velocity, and lower frequency of up-and-down strokes in non-alphabetical as well as in alphabetical writing. In the patient group, Spearman correlation analysis between overt writing performance and NIV was significant. That means patients who had less errors in writing a sentence showed a higher automaticity in handwriting. The correctness of alphabetical writing and some kinematographic measures in writing non-alphabetical material reached excellent diagnostic values in ROC analyses. There was no difference in the application of pressure on the pen between patients and controls.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nWriting disorders are multi-componential in AD and not strictly limited to one processing level. The slow and poorly automated execution of motor programs is not bound to alphabetical material.",

Significance Collagen is the most abundant structural protein in humans and as such, is often used in biomedical applications for tissue repair and regeneration. Designing de novo collagen to maintain its structural integrity in vivo, important for its mechanical performance and subsequent utility, remains a challenge today. In this work, we develop a deep learning framework to generate collagen sequences with desired thermal stability and validate our deep learning framework using both simulation and experiment. Given this validation, we discover key insights into the prevalence of amino acids in collagen triple helices and find a mechanistic relationship between our simulations and experiment. This framework enables researchers to develop collagen sequences with desired thermal stability for biomedical applications.",

        "abstract": "An SGD-like algorithm that injects random noise before computing gradients while leveraging the symmetry of $\\mathcal{P}$ to reduce variance is considered, showing matching upper and lower bounds of the algorithm for finding an approximate first-order stationary point of $F$ when the gradient of $f$ is Lipschitz-continuous. We consider finding flat, local minimizers by adding average weight perturbations. Given a nonconvex function $f: \\mathbb{R}^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and a $d$-dimensional distribution $\\mathcal{P}$ which is symmetric at zero, we perturb the weight of $f$ and define $F(W) = \\mathbb{E}[f({W + U})]$, where $U$ is a random sample from $\\mathcal{P}$. This injection induces regularization through the Hessian trace of $f$ for small, isotropic Gaussian perturbations. Thus, the weight-perturbed function biases to minimizers with low Hessian trace. Several prior works have studied settings related to this weight-perturbed function by designing algorithms to improve generalization. Still, convergence rates are not known for finding minima under the average perturbations of the function $F$. This paper considers an SGD-like algorithm that injects random noise before computing gradients while leveraging the symmetry of $\\mathcal{P}$ to reduce variance. We then provide a rigorous analysis, showing matching upper and lower bounds of our algorithm for finding an approximate first-order stationary point of $F$ when the gradient of $f$ is Lipschitz-continuous. We empirically validate our algorithm for several image classification tasks with various architectures. Compared to sharpness-aware minimization, we note a 12.6% and 7.8% drop in the Hessian trace and top eigenvalue of the found minima, respectively, averaged over eight datasets. Ablation studies validate the benefit of the design of our algorithm.",

Pre-trained language models have achieved promising performance on general benchmarks, but underperform when migrated to a specific domain. Recent works perform pre-training from scratch or continual pre-training on domain corpora. However, in many specific domains, the limited corpus can hardly support obtaining precise representations. To address this issue, we propose a novel Transformer-based language model named VarMAE for domain-adaptive language understanding. Under the masked autoencoding objective, we design a context uncertainty learning module to encode the token's context into a smooth latent distribution. The module can produce diverse and well-formed contextual representations. Experiments on science- and finance-domain NLU tasks demonstrate that VarMAE can be efficiently adapted to new domains with limited resources.",

        "abstract": "This survey presents a comprehensive review and analysis of the recent progress of CL in NLP, which has significant differences from CL in computer vision and machine learning. Continual learning (CL) is a learning paradigm that emulates the human capability of learning and accumulating knowledge continually without forgetting the previously learned knowledge and also transferring the learned knowledge to help learn new tasks better. This survey presents a comprehensive review and analysis of the recent progress of CL in NLP, which has significant differences from CL in computer vision and machine learning. It covers (1) all CL settings with a taxonomy of existing techniques; (2) catastrophic forgetting (CF) prevention, (3) knowledge transfer (KT), which is particularly important for NLP tasks; and (4) some theory and the hidden challenge of inter-task class separation (ICS). (1), (3) and (4) have not been included in the existing survey. Finally, a list of future directions is discussed.",

        "abstract": "Verified by four regression problems, it is demonstrated that the proposed RBF-MLP-II exhibits the best approximation accuracy and fastest training convergence compared to conventional MLPs,RBF-NNs, and RBf- MLP-I. By combining multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and radial basis function neural networks (RBF-NNs), an efficient multilayer RBF network is proposed in this work for regression problems. As an extension to the existing multilayer RBF network (RBF-MLP-I), the new multilayer RBF network (RBF-MLP-II) first nonlinearly transforms the multi-dimensional input data by adopting a set of multivariate basis functions. Then, linear weighted sums of these basis functions, i.e., the RBF approximations, are computed in the first hidden layer and used as the features of this layer. Subsequently, in the following hidden layers, each feature of the preceding hidden layer is fed into a univariate RBF characterized by the trainable scalar center and width, and then, RBF approximations are also applied to these basis functions. Finally, the features of the last hidden layer are linearly transformed to approximate the target output data. RBF-MLP-II reduces the number of parameters in basis functions and thus the network complexity of RBF-MLP-I. Verified by four regression problems, it is demonstrated that the proposed RBF-MLP-II exhibits the best approximation accuracy and fastest training convergence compared to conventional MLPs, RBF-NNs, and RBF-MLP-I.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes TimeMAE, a novel self-supervised paradigm for learning transferrable time series representations based on transformer networks, and designs a decoupled autoencoder architecture, which learns the representations of visible (unmasked) positions and masked ones with two different encoder modules, respectively. Enhancing the expressive capacity of deep learning-based time series models with self-supervised pre-training has become ever-increasingly prevalent in time series classification. Even though numerous efforts have been devoted to developing self-supervised models for time series data, we argue that the current methods are not sufficient to learn optimal time series representations due to solely unidirectional encoding over sparse point-wise input units. In this work, we propose TimeMAE, a novel self-supervised paradigm for learning transferrable time series representations based on transformer networks. The distinct characteristics of the TimeMAE lie in processing each time series into a sequence of non-overlapping sub-series via window-slicing partitioning, followed by random masking strategies over the semantic units of localized sub-series. Such a simple yet effective setting can help us achieve the goal of killing three birds with one stone, i.e., (1) learning enriched contextual representations of time series with a bidirectional encoding scheme; (2) increasing the information density of basic semantic units; (3) efficiently encoding representations of time series using transformer networks. Nevertheless, it is a non-trivial to perform reconstructing task over such a novel formulated modeling paradigm. To solve the discrepancy issue incurred by newly injected masked embeddings, we design a decoupled autoencoder architecture, which learns the representations of visible (unmasked) positions and masked ones with two different encoder modules, respectively. Furthermore, we construct two types of informative targets to accomplish the corresponding pretext tasks. One is to create a tokenizer module that assigns a codeword to each masked region, allowing the masked codeword classification (MCC) task to be completed effectively...",

The development of a human in vitro system that can be patient-specific, induced pluripotent stem cells, iPSC, and the ability to obtain various cell types of interest, have empowered human disease modeling and therapeutic development. Scalable tools have been deployed for gene modulation in these cells and derivatives, including pharmacological means, DNA-based RNA interference and standard RNA interference (shRNA/siRNA). The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system, borrowed from bacteria and adopted for use in mammalian cells a decade ago, offers cell-specific genetic targeting and versatility. Outside genome editing, more subtle, time-resolved gene modulation is possible by using a catalytically \u201cdead\u201d Cas9 enzyme linked to an effector of gene transcription in combination with a guide RNA. The CRISPRi / CRISPRa (interference/activation) system evolved over the last decade as a scalable technology for performing functional genomics with libraries of gRNAs.

        "abstract": "This work provides a new paradigm for designing behavioral studies towards a rigorous view of the role of machine explanations across different tasks of human-AI decision making, and concludes that human intuitions are necessary for generating and evaluating machine explanations in human- AI decision making. Explanations are hypothesized to improve human understanding of machine learning models and achieve a variety of desirable outcomes, ranging from model debugging to enhancing human decision making. However, empirical studies have found mixed and even negative results. An open question, therefore, is under what conditions explanations can improve human understanding and in what way. To address this question, we first identify three core concepts that cover most existing quantitative measures of understanding: task decision boundary, model decision boundary, and model error. Using adapted causal diagrams, we provide a formal characterization of the relationship between these concepts and human approximations (i.e., understanding) of them. The relationship varies by the level of human intuition in different task types, such as emulation and discovery, which are often ignored when building or evaluating explanation methods. Our key result is that human intuitions are necessary for generating and evaluating machine explanations in human-AI decision making: without assumptions about human intuitions, explanations may improve human understanding of model decision boundary, but cannot improve human understanding of task decision boundary or model error. To validate our theoretical claims, we conduct human subject studies to show the importance of human intuitions. Together with our theoretical contributions, we provide a new paradigm for designing behavioral studies towards a rigorous view of the role of machine explanations across different tasks of human-AI decision making.",

        "abstract": "It is found that past and future thinking occupy highly separable regions of processing space, supporting the Complementarity Hypothesis. Imagining the future and remembering the past both involve mental time travel. This commonality could indicate shared mental processes, as held by the Constructive Episodic Simulation Hypothesis (Schacter & Addis, 2008), or else interactive processes that complement one another, a possibility we call the Complementarity Hypothesis. According to the Complementarity Hypothesis, future thoughts are constructed from schemas making them episodically poor, whereas past thoughts are constructed from schemas and direct retrieval of memory traces, making them relatively episodically rich. We tested these hypotheses using machine learning to data mine mental operations in language, much as a geologist can recover physical processes from the geological record. People\u2019s natural, unprompted talk on web blogs was automatically analyzed for past, present, and future references using a temporal orientation classifier. In Study 1, we found that perceptual details were mentioned more often in past than future talk, implying greater use of episodic processing in past than future thinking. In Study 2, a neural network using schemas generated from Latent Dirichlet Allocation better predicted the content of references to the future than the past, implying that constructive processes are more common in future than past thinking. In Study 3, we used the results from the two prior studies to construct an episodic-by-constructive process space. We adapted techniques from fMRI analysis to analyze this space for clusters of activity, as if the frequency of past and future thinking were BOLD responses in cortical space. We found that past and future thinking occupy highly separable regions of processing space, supporting the Complementarity Hypothesis.",

        "abstract": "The results prove that deep learning with chest X-ray images can extract significant biomarkers related to COVID-19, since the obtained accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 96.5%, 98.0%, and 91.7%, respectively. The COVID-19 is a new disease from the virus SARS-CoV-2, the infection can cause respiratory illness with symptoms such as cough, fever, and, in severe cases, pneumonia. Early diagnosis is crucial for the correct treatment to reduce as much as possible the stress in the healthcare system. The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this disease. In this study, we have applied learning transfer to a convolutional neural network known as AlexNet for binary chest X-ray recognition (COVID-19 vs Healthy). We have fine-tunned AlexNet for our specific problem. The first layer, which works with RGB images, is replaced for images in a single intensity (grayscale). 11,312 chest X-ray images from six public databases were used to train the network. Among them are samples of healthy people and samples that present the effect of pneumonia and COVID-19 diseases. The results prove that deep learning with chest X-ray images can extract significant biomarkers related to COVID-19, since the obtained accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 96.5%, 98.0%, and 91.7%, respectively. ROC analysis and confusion matrices are used to validate the results of the fine-tunned AlexNet network",

Early diagnosis is critical for the development and success of interventions, and neuroimaging is one of the most promising areas for early detection of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). This study is aimed to develop a deep learning method to extract useful AD biomarkers from structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and classify brain images into AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN) groups. In this work, we adapted and trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on sMRI images of the brain from ADNI datasets available in online databases. Our proposed mechanism was used to combine features from different layers to hierarchically transform the images from magnetic resonance imaging into more compact high-level features. The proposed method has reduced number of parameters which reduces the computation complexity. The method is compared with the existing state-of-the-art works for AD classification, which show superior results for the widely used evaluation metrics including accuracy, area under the ROC curve etc., suggesting that our proposed convolution operation is suitable for the AD diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "In addition to more focal GM MTI changes in the temporal and frontal lobes, widespread WM changes are present in the earliest stages of AD, which might point to an important role for WM pathology in the early stage of AD. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies have shown involvement of both gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD). In this study, we assessed the lobar distribution of the GM and WM pathology over the brain and the association of lobar distribution with global cognitive decline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients with AD, 19 patients with MCI, and 43 subjects with normal cognitive function participated in this study. GM and WM were segmented on dual fast spin-echo and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MR images. A custom template representing anatomic areas was applied. Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) peak height and mean magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) provided measures for structural brain damage. RESULTS: Both mean MTR and MTI peak height showed that patients with AD had more structural brain damage in the GM of all lobes compared with controls. Patients with MCI had lower GM peak height compared with controls for the temporal and frontal lobe. WM peak height was lower for all lobes investigated for patients with both AD and MCI. WM mean MTR was lower in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes for patients with AD compared with controls. Age and both temporal GM peak height and mean MTR were the only parameters that predicted cognition. CONCLUSION: This study shows that in addition to more focal GM MTI changes in the temporal and frontal lobes, widespread WM changes are present in the earliest stages of AD. This might point to an important role for WM pathology in the earliest stage of AD.",

        "abstract": "This work studies the class of large-scale pre-trained networks presented by Kolesnikov et al. on three diverse imaging tasks and finds that for some of these properties transfer from natural to medical images is indeed extremely effective, but only when performed at sufficient scale. Transfer learning is a standard technique to improve performance on tasks with limited data. However, for medical imaging, the value of transfer learning is less clear. This is likely due to the large domain mismatch between the usual natural-image pre-training (e.g. ImageNet) and medical images. However, recent advances in transfer learning have shown substantial improvements from scale. We investigate whether modern methods can change the fortune of transfer learning for medical imaging. For this, we study the class of large-scale pre-trained networks presented by Kolesnikov et al. on three diverse imaging tasks: chest radiography, mammography, and dermatology. We study both transfer performance and critical properties for the deployment in the medical domain, including: out-of-distribution generalization, data-efficiency, sub-group fairness, and uncertainty estimation. Interestingly, we find that for some of these properties transfer from natural to medical images is indeed extremely effective, but only when performed at sufficient scale.",

        "abstract": "This research demonstrates that the performance of automatic SLAMs as dementia assessment methods can improve if they are used to use the picture description task to obtain participants\u2019 speech and train ML classifiers using only acoustic features. Automatic speech and language assessment methods (SLAMs) can help clinicians assess speech and language impairments associated with dementia in older adults. The basis of any automatic SLAMs is a machine learning (ML) classifier that is trained on participants\u2019 speech and language. However, language tasks, recording media, and modalities impact the performance of ML classifiers. Thus, this research has focused on evaluating the effects of the above-mentioned factors on the performance of ML classifiers that can be used for dementia assessment. Our methodology includes the following steps: (1) Collecting speech and language datasets from patients and healthy controls; (2) Using feature engineering methods which include feature extraction methods to extract linguistic and acoustic features and feature selection methods to select most informative features; (3) Training different ML classifiers; and (4) Evaluating the performance of ML classifiers to investigate the impacts of language tasks, recording media, and modalities on dementia assessment. Our results show that (1) the ML classifiers trained with the picture description language task perform better than the classifiers trained with the story recall language task; (2) the data obtained from phone-based recordings improves the performance of ML classifiers compared to data obtained from web-based recordings; and (3) the ML classifiers trained with acoustic features perform better than the classifiers trained with linguistic features. This research demonstrates that we can improve the performance of automatic SLAMs as dementia assessment methods if we: (1) Use the picture description task to obtain participants\u2019 speech; (2) Collect participants\u2019 voices via phone-based recordings; and (3) Train ML classifiers using only acoustic features. Our proposed methodology will help future researchers to investigate the impacts of different factors on the performance of ML classifiers for assessing dementia.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is now widely used method in increasing the photovoltaic (PV) efficiency. The conventional MPPT methods have many problems concerning the accuracy, flexibility and efficiency. The MPP depends on the PV temperature and solar irradiation that randomly varied. In this paper an artificial intelligence based controller is presented through implementing of an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to obtain maximum power from PV. The ANFIS inputs are the temperature and cell current, and the output is optimal voltage at maximum power. During operation the trained ANFIS senses the PV current using suitable sensor and also senses the temperature to determine the optimal operating voltage that corresponds to the current at MPP. This voltage is used to control the boost converter duty cycle. The MATLAB simulation results shows the effectiveness of the ANFIS with sensing the PV current in obtaining the MPPT from the PV.",

        "abstract": "How advances in engineering, chemistry, and biology have enabled the development of bioactive, 3D structures that closely imitate native supramolecular assemblies and have the capacity to deliver in a localized and sustained manner viable cell populations and/or bioactive/therapeutic molecules is reviewed. Collagen is the oldest and most abundant extracellular matrix protein that has found many applications in food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and biomedical industries. First, an overview of the family of collagens and their respective structures, conformation, and biosynthesis is provided. The advances and shortfalls of various collagen preparations (e.g., mammalian/marine extracted collagen, cell\u2010produced collagens, recombinant collagens, and collagen\u2010like peptides) and crosslinking technologies (e.g., chemical, physical, and biological) are then critically discussed. Subsequently, an array of structural, thermal, mechanical, biochemical, and biological assays is examined, which are developed to analyze and characterize collagenous structures. Lastly, a comprehensive review is provided on how advances in engineering, chemistry, and biology have enabled the development of bioactive, 3D structures (e.g., tissue grafts, biomaterials, cell\u2010assembled tissue equivalents) that closely imitate native supramolecular assemblies and have the capacity to deliver in a localized and sustained manner viable cell populations and/or bioactive/therapeutic molecules. Clearly, collagens have a long history in both evolution and biotechnology and continue to offer both challenges and exciting opportunities in regenerative medicine as nature's biomaterial of choice.",

We study the iteration complexity of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for minimizing the gradient norm of smooth, possibly nonconvex functions. We provide several results, implying that the classical $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-4})$ upper bound (for making the average gradient norm less than $\\epsilon$) cannot be improved upon, unless a combination of additional assumptions is made.

        "abstract": "This work offers a theoretical explanation of how random masks can approximate arbitrary target networks if they are wider by a logarithmic factor in the inverse sparsity, and proposes particularly effective choices of initial layer-wise sparsity ratios of the random source network. Random masks define surprisingly effective sparse neural network models, as has been shown empirically. The resulting sparse networks can often compete with dense architectures and state-of-the-art lottery ticket pruning algorithms, even though they do not rely on computationally expensive prune-train iterations and can be drawn initially without significant computational overhead. We offer a theoretical explanation of how random masks can approximate arbitrary target networks if they are wider by a logarithmic factor in the inverse sparsity $1 / \\log(1/\\text{sparsity})$. This overparameterization factor is necessary at least for 3-layer random networks, which elucidates the observed degrading performance of random networks at higher sparsity. At moderate to high sparsity levels, however, our results imply that sparser networks are contained within random source networks so that any dense-to-sparse training scheme can be turned into a computationally more efficient sparse-to-sparse one by constraining the search to a fixed random mask. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in experiments for different pruning methods and propose particularly effective choices of initial layer-wise sparsity ratios of the random source network. As a special case, we show theoretically and experimentally that random source networks also contain strong lottery tickets.",

        "abstract": "An empirical investigation into known methods to mitigate catastrophic forgetting is conducted and it is found that elastic weight consolidation provides best overall scores yielding only a 0.33% drop in performance across seven generic tasks while remaining competitive in bio-medical tasks. Pre-training large language models has become a standard in the natural language processing community. Such models are pre-trained on generic data (e.g. BookCorpus and English Wikipedia) and often fine-tuned on tasks in the same domain. However, in order to achieve state-of-the-art performance on out of domain tasks such as clinical named entity recognition and relation extraction, additional in domain pre-training is required. In practice, staged multi-domain pre-training presents performance deterioration in the form of catastrophic forgetting (CF) when evaluated on a generic benchmark such as GLUE. In this paper we conduct an empirical investigation into known methods to mitigate CF. We find that elastic weight consolidation provides best overall scores yielding only a 0.33% drop in performance across seven generic tasks while remaining competitive in bio-medical tasks. Furthermore, we explore gradient and latent clustering based data selection techniques to improve coverage when using elastic weight consolidation and experience replay methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a framework, named Continual Learning for Weakly Supervised Text Classification (CL-WSTC), which can take any WSTC method as base model and can achieve a better trade-off between classification accuracy and decision timeliness compared to non-continual counterparts. Continual text classification is an important research direction in Web mining. Existing works are limited to supervised approaches relying on abundant labeled data, but in the open and dynamic environment of Internet, involving constant semantic change of known topics and the appearance of unknown topics, text annotations are hard to access in time for each period. That calls for the technique of weakly supervised text classification (WSTC), which requires just seed words for each category and has succeed in static text classification tasks. However, there are still no studies of applying WSTC methods in a continual learning paradigm to actually accommodate the open and evolving Internet. In this paper, we tackle this problem for the first time and propose a framework, named Continual Learning for Weakly Supervised Text Classification (CL-WSTC), which can take any WSTC method as base model. It consists of two modules, classification decision with delay and seed word updating. In the former, the probability threshold for each category in each period is adaptively learned to determine the acceptance/rejection of texts. In the latter, with candidate words output by the base model, seed words are added and deleted via reinforcement learning with immediate rewards, according to an empirically certified unsupervised measure. Extensive experiments show that our approach has strong universality and can achieve a better trade-off between classification accuracy and decision timeliness compared to non-continual counterparts, with intuitively interpretable updating of seed words.",

        "abstract": "The seasonal nature of fruits and vegetables has an immense impact on the process of seeking methods that allow extending the shelf life in this category of food. It is observed that through continuous technological changes, it is also possible to notice changes in the methods used to examine and study food and its microbiological aspects. It should be added that a new trend of bioactive ingredient consumption is also on the increase, which translates into numerous attempts that are made to keep the high quality of those products for a longer time. New and modern methods are being sought in this area, where the main aim is to support drying processes and quality control during food processing. This review provides deep insight into the application of artificial intelligence (AI) using a multi-layer perceptron network (MLPN) and other machine learning algorithms to evaluate the effective prediction and classification of the obtained vegetables and fruits during convection as well as spray drying. AI in food drying, especially for entrepreneurs and researchers, can be a huge chance to speed up development, lower production costs, effective quality control and higher production efficiency. Current scientific findings confirm that the selection of appropriate parameters, among others, such as color, shape, texture, sound, initial volume, drying time, air temperature, airflow velocity, area difference, moisture content and final thickness, have an influence on the yield as well as the quality of the obtained dried vegetables and fruits. Moreover, scientific discoveries prove that the technology of drying fruits and vegetables supported by artificial intelligence offers an alternative in process optimization and quality control and, even in an indirect way, can prolong the freshness of food rich in various nutrients. In the future, the main challenge will be the application of artificial intelligence in most production lines in real time in order to control the parameters of the process or control the quality of raw materials obtained in the process of drying.",

        "abstract": "This paper designs a random group permutation method combined with multi-layer convolutional networks to learn the low-dimensional features from multivariate time series data and proposes a novel MTSC model with an attentional prototype network to take the strengths of both traditional and deep learning based approaches. With the advance of sensor technologies, the Multivariate Time Series classification (MTSC) problem, perhaps one of the most essential problems in the time series data mining domain, has continuously received a significant amount of attention in recent decades. Traditional time series classification approaches based on Bag-of-Patterns or Time Series Shapelet have difficulty dealing with the huge amounts of feature candidates generated in high-dimensional multivariate data but have promising performance even when the training set is small. In contrast, deep learning based methods can learn low-dimensional features efficiently but suffer from a shortage of labelled data. In this paper, we propose a novel MTSC model with an attentional prototype network to take the strengths of both traditional and deep learning based approaches. Specifically, we design a random group permutation method combined with multi-layer convolutional networks to learn the low-dimensional features from multivariate time series data. To handle the issue of limited training labels, we propose a novel attentional prototype network to train the feature representation based on their distance to class prototypes with inadequate data labels. In addition, we extend our model into its semi-supervised setting by utilizing the unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on 18 datasets in a public UEA Multivariate time series archive with eight state-of-the-art baseline methods exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed model.",

Abstract CRISPR-based technology has provided new avenues to interrogate gene function, but difficulties in transgene expression in post-mitotic neurons has delayed incorporation of these tools in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient, neuron-optimized dual lentiviral CRISPR-based transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) system capable of robust, modular, and tunable gene induction and multiplexed gene regulation across several primary rodent neuron culture systems. CRISPRa targeting unique promoters in the complex multi-transcript gene brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) revealed both transcript- and genome-level selectivity of this approach, in addition to highlighting downstream transcriptional and physiological consequences of Bdnf regulation. Finally, we illustrate that CRISPRa is highly efficient in vivo, resulting in increased protein levels of a target gene in diverse brain structures. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CRISPRa is an efficient and selective method to study gene expression programs in brain health and disease.",

        "abstract": "It is argued explanations are only useful to the extent that they allow a human decision maker to verify the correctness of an AI's prediction, in contrast to other desiderata, e.g., interpretability or spelling out the AI's reasoning process. The current literature on AI-advised decision making -- involving explainable AI systems advising human decision makers -- presents a series of inconclusive and confounding results. To synthesize these findings, we propose a simple theory that elucidates the frequent failure of AI explanations to engender appropriate reliance and complementary decision making performance. We argue explanations are only useful to the extent that they allow a human decision maker to verify the correctness of an AI's prediction, in contrast to other desiderata, e.g., interpretability or spelling out the AI's reasoning process. Prior studies find in many decision making contexts AI explanations do not facilitate such verification. Moreover, most tasks fundamentally do not allow easy verification, regardless of explanation method, limiting the potential benefit of any type of explanation. We also compare the objective of complementary performance with that of appropriate reliance, decomposing the latter into the notions of outcome-graded and strategy-graded reliance.",

        "abstract": "This work proposed that one of the most important adaptive functions of long-term episodic memory is to store information about the past in the service of planning for the personal future, and predicted that future-oriented planning would result in especially good memory relative to other memory tasks. All organisms capable of long-term memory are necessarily oriented toward the future. We propose that one of the most important adaptive functions of long-term episodic memory is to store information about the past in the service of planning for the personal future. Because a system should have especially efficient performance when engaged in a task that makes maximal use of its evolved machinery, we predicted that future-oriented planning would result in especially good memory relative to other memory tasks. We tested recall performance of a word list, using encoding tasks with different temporal perspectives (e.g., past, future) but a similar context. Consistent with our hypothesis, future-oriented encoding produced superior recall. We discuss these findings in light of their implications for the thesis that memory evolved to enable its possessor to anticipate and respond to future contingencies that cannot be known with certainty.",

        "abstract": "This research determines that using the CascadeNet and ResNet algorithms, it can precisely classify Alzheimer's disease stages in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the proposed architecture and compares its performance with that of similar deep learning methods. Neuroimaging is used for diagnosing neuropathological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) model is evaluated for its ability to improve AD diagnosis. Accordingly, we determine that using the CascadeNet and ResNet algorithms, we can precisely classify Alzheimer's disease stages in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Based on Kaggle datasets, we validate the proposed architecture and compare its performance with that of similar deep learning methods. We achieved 99.02% accuracy using quaternary classification. There was an accuracy of quaternary classification between all AD subtypes in the proposed model. Cascade-ResNet has better classification accuracy and processing complexity than other deep CNNs. The proposed model outperforms the current state-of-the-art deep learning methods when applied to MRI. Furthermore, the hybrid Cascade-ResNet performed well without the need for feature extraction and was insensitive to existing noise in the imaging. Consequently, untrained operators are able to apply the proposed model to digital patient imaging data. By distinguishing between AD patients and healthy individuals, this research can enhance value-based care in clinical settings.",

        "abstract": "MTI in AD allows the assessment of ongoing global and regional brain damage independent of atrophy, and therefore appears to be a valuable marker for disease-related tissue changes. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MTI has been proposed as a sensitive technique for studying microstructural brain tissue changes in patients with AD, but the course of these changes over time is largely unknown. We therefore used a placebo-controlled study of memantine to follow the evolution of tissue damage in AD by means of MTR measurements and investigated how MTR changes were related to brain atrophy and cognition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients (76.5 \u00b1 5.8 years) with mild to moderate AD underwent MTI, brain volume measurements, and cognitive testing at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. Nineteen healthy individuals (73.3 \u00b1 3.2 years) served as controls. MTI was performed with a 2-minute protocol that was optimized for an enhanced MT effect and reduced motion sensitivity. Global and regional MTR measurements served as correlations with brain volumes and the MMSE score. RESULTS: AD patients had significantly lower global MTR values than controls, and showed a consistent and significant MTR reduction in all regions investigated over a period of 12 months. These MTR changes were paralleled by a brain tissue loss of 2.2% per year. Associations between MTR and cognition were found for the hippocampus, putamen, and thalamus, and were more pronounced in the left hemisphere. CONCLUSIONS: MTI in AD allows the assessment of ongoing global and regional brain damage independent of atrophy, and therefore appears to be a valuable marker for disease-related tissue changes.",

        "abstract": "This work conducts largescale pre-training on large source datasets of either natural (ImageNet-21k/1k) or medical chest X-Ray images and compares full and few-shot transfer using different target datasets from both natural and medical imaging domains, indicating possibility to obtain high quality models for domain-specific transfer by pre- training instead on comparably very large, generic source data. Transfer learning aims to exploit pre-trained models for more efficient follow-up training on wide range of downstream tasks and datasets, enabling successful training also on small data. Recent line of work posits strong benefits for model generalization and transfer when model size, data size, and compute budget are increased for the pre-training. It remains however still largely unclear whether the observed transfer improvement due to increase in scale also holds when source and target data distributions are far apart from each other. In this work we conduct largescale pre-training on large source datasets of either natural (ImageNet-21k/1k) or medical chest X-Ray images and compare full and few-shot transfer using different target datasets from both natural and medical imaging domains1. Our observations provide evidence that while pre-training and transfer on closely related datasets do show clear benefit of increasing model and data size during pre-training, such benefits are not clearly visible when source and target datasets are further apart. These observations hold across both full and few-shot transfer and indicate that scaling laws pointing to improvement of generalization and transfer with increasing model and data size are incomplete and should be revised by taking into account the type and proximity of the source and target data, to correctly predict the effect of model and data scale during pre-training on transfer. Remarkably, in full shot transfer to a large X-Ray chest imaging target (PadChest), the largest model pretrained on ImageNet-21k slightly outperforms best models pre-trained on large X-Ray chest imaging data. This indicates possibility to obtain high quality models for domain-specific transfer even without access to large domain-specific data, by pre-training instead on comparably very large, generic source data.",

        "abstract": "The results verify that the tree-based classi\ufb01ers, which have been trained using the linguistic and acoustic features extracted from interviews\u2019 transcript and audio, can be used to develop an AI-powered language assessment tool for detecting language impairment associated with dementia. The main objective of this paper is to propose an approach for developing an Arti\ufb01cial Intelli-gence (AI)-powered Language Assessment (LA) tool. Such tools can be used to assess language impairments associated with dementia in older adults. The Machine Learning (ML) classi\ufb01ers are the main parts of our proposed approach, therefore to develop an accurate tool with high sensitivity and speci\ufb01city, we consider different binary classi\ufb01ers and evaluate their performances. We also assess the reliability and validity of our approach by comparing the impact of different types of language tasks, features, and recording media on the performance of ML classi\ufb01ers. Our approach includes the following steps: 1) Collecting language datasets or getting access to available language datasets; 2) Extracting linguistic and acoustic features from subjects\u2019 speeches which have been collected from subjects with dementia ( N =9) and subjects without dementia ( N =13); 3) Selecting most informative features and using them to train ML classi\ufb01ers; and 4) Evaluating the performance of classi\ufb01ers on distinguishing subjects with dementia from subjects without dementia and select the most accurate classi\ufb01er to be the basis of the AI tool. Our results indicate that 1) we can \ufb01nd more predictive linguistic markers to distinguish language impairment associated with dementia from participants\u2019 speech produced during the Picture Description (PD) language task than the Story Recall (SR) task; and 2) phone-based recording interfaces provide more high-quality language datasets than the web-based recording systems Our results verify that the tree-based classi\ufb01ers, which have been trained using the linguistic and acoustic features extracted from interviews\u2019 transcript and audio, can be used to develop an AI-powered language assessment tool for detecting language impairment associated with dementia.",

        "abstract": "Impaired information flow in the resting-state networks of the aMCI and AD groups was found versus normal groups, and effective connectivity can serve as a potential marker of Alzheimer\u2019s pathophysiology, even in the early stages of the disease. (1) Background: Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a high prevalence. Despite the cognitive tests to diagnose AD, there are pitfalls in early diagnosis. Brain deposition of pathological markers of AD can affect the direction and intensity of the signaling. The study of effective connectivity allows the evaluation of intensity flow and signaling pathways in functional regions, even in the early stage, known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). (2) Methods: 16 aMCI, 13 AD, and 14 normal subjects were scanned using resting-state fMRI and T1-weighted protocols. After data pre-processing, the signal of the predefined nodes was extracted, and spectral dynamic causal modeling analysis (spDCM) was constructed. Afterward, the mean and standard deviation of the Jacobin matrix of each subject describing effective connectivity was calculated and compared. (3) Results: The maps of effective connectivity in the brain networks of the three groups were different, and the direction and strength of the causal effect with the progression of the disease showed substantial changes. (4) Conclusions: Impaired information flow in the resting-state networks of the aMCI and AD groups was found versus normal groups. Effective connectivity can serve as a potential marker of Alzheimer\u2019s pathophysiology, even in the early stages of the disease.",

        "abstract": "This paper highlights recent technologies to produce and utilize recombinant collagens, and it contemplates their prospects and limitations. Collagens provide the building blocks for diverse tissues and organs. Furthermore, these proteins act as signaling molecules that control cell behavior during organ development, growth, and repair. Their long half-life, mechanical strength, ability to assemble into fibrils and networks, biocompatibility, and abundance from readily available discarded animal tissues make collagens an attractive material in biomedicine, drug and food industries, and cosmetic products. About three decades ago, pioneering experiments led to recombinant human collagens\u2019 expression, thereby initiating studies on the potential use of these proteins as substitutes for the animal-derived collagens. Since then, scientists have utilized various systems to produce native-like recombinant collagens and their fragments. They also tested these collagens as materials to repair tissues, deliver drugs, and serve as therapeutics. Although many tests demonstrated that recombinant collagens perform as well as their native counterparts, the recombinant collagen technology has not yet been adopted by the biomedical, pharmaceutical, or food industry. This paper highlights recent technologies to produce and utilize recombinant collagens, and it contemplates their prospects and limitations.",

        "abstract": "A novel quasi-optimal learning algorithm is developed which can be easily optimized in off-policy settings with guaranteed convergence under general function approximations and is evaluated with comprehensive simulated experiments and a dose suggestion real application to Ohio Type 1 diabetes dataset. Many real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL) require making decisions in continuous action environments. In particular, determining the optimal dose level plays a vital role in developing medical treatment regimes. One challenge in adapting existing RL algorithms to medical applications, however, is that the popular infinite support stochastic policies, e.g., Gaussian policy, may assign riskily high dosages and harm patients seriously. Hence, it is important to induce a policy class whose support only contains near-optimal actions, and shrink the action-searching area for effectiveness and reliability. To achieve this, we develop a novel quasi-optimal learning algorithm, which can be easily optimized in off-policy settings with guaranteed convergence under general function approximations. Theoretically, we analyze the consistency, sample complexity, adaptability, and convergence of the proposed algorithm. We evaluate our algorithm with comprehensive simulated experiments and a dose suggestion real application to Ohio Type 1 diabetes dataset.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a method to train sparse neural networks with a fixed parameter count and a fixed computational cost throughout training, without sacrificing accuracy relative to existing dense-to-sparse training methods. Many applications require sparse neural networks due to space or inference time restrictions. There is a large body of work on training dense networks to yield sparse networks for inference, but this limits the size of the largest trainable sparse model to that of the largest trainable dense model. In this paper we introduce a method to train sparse neural networks with a fixed parameter count and a fixed computational cost throughout training, without sacrificing accuracy relative to existing dense-to-sparse training methods. Our method updates the topology of the sparse network during training by using parameter magnitudes and infrequent gradient calculations. We show that this approach requires fewer floating-point operations (FLOPs) to achieve a given level of accuracy compared to prior techniques. We demonstrate state-of-the-art sparse training results on a variety of networks and datasets, including ResNet-50, MobileNets on Imagenet-2012, and RNNs on WikiText-103. Finally, we provide some insights into why allowing the topology to change during the optimization can overcome local minima encountered when the topology remains static.

        "abstract": "A novel, compute-efficient framework that utilizes Document metadata and Domain-Specific Taxonomy as supervision signals to pre-train transformer encoder on a domain-specific corpus, and shows a negligible drop in performance on open-domain benchmarks. Pre-training Transformers has shown promising results on open-domain and domain-specific downstream tasks. However, state-of-the-art Transformers require an unreasonably large amount of pre-training data and compute. In this paper, we propose $FPDM$ (Fast Pre-training Technique using Document Level Metadata), a novel, compute-efficient framework that utilizes Document metadata and Domain-Specific Taxonomy as supervision signals to pre-train transformer encoder on a domain-specific corpus. The main innovation is that during domain-specific pretraining, an open-domain encoder is continually pre-trained using sentence-level embeddings as inputs (to accommodate long documents), however, fine-tuning is done with token-level embeddings as inputs to this encoder. We show that $FPDM$ outperforms several transformer-based baselines in terms of character-level F1 scores and other automated metrics in the Customer Support, Scientific, and Legal Domains, and shows a negligible drop in performance on open-domain benchmarks. Importantly, the novel use of document-level supervision along with sentence-level embedding input for pre-training reduces pre-training compute by around $1,000$, $4,500$, and $500$ times compared to MLM and/or NSP in Customer Support, Scientific, and Legal Domains, respectively.

        "abstract": "Experimental results on five real short-text datasets show that the proposed models outperform the state-of-theart methods, and especially perform well when the categories are overlapping and interrelated. Dataless text classification has attracted increasing attentions recently. It only needs very few seed words of each category to classify documents, which is much cheaper than supervised text classification that requires massive labeling efforts. However, most of existing models pay attention to long texts, but get unsatisfactory performance on short texts, which have become increasingly popular on the Internet. In this paper, we at first propose a novel model named Seeded Biterm Topic Model (SeedBTM) extending BTM to solve the problem of dataless short text classification with seed words. It takes advantage of both word co-occurrence information in the topic model and category-word similarity from widely used word embeddings as the prior topic-in-set knowledge. Moreover, with the same approach, we also propose Seeded Twitter Biterm Topic Model (SeedTBTM), which extends Twitter-BTM and utilizes additional user information to achieve higher classification accuracy. Experimental results on five real short-text datasets show that our models outperform the state-of-theart methods, and especially perform well when the categories are overlapping and interrelated.",

        "abstract": "A residual channel and temporal attention (CT_CAM) module is proposed, which aims to refine the feature extracted from the convolutional neural network and thus improve the classification performance of MTSC. Multivariate time series classification (MTSC) is a fundamental and essential research problem in the domain of time series data mining. Recently deep neural networks emerged as an end-to-end solution for MTSC and achieve state-of-the-art results on several public datasets. It is favored by its hierarchical feature extraction ability and most of the researches focus on designing a network architecture to ensure its performance on MTSC. Despite this, there are seldom investigations on the attention mechanism in MTSC, which has been demonstrated as an effective module to extract features in other domains. In this paper, we propose a residual channel and temporal attention (CT_CAM) module, which aims to refine the feature extracted from the convolutional neural network and thus improve the classification performance. Extensive experiments on 15 public MTSC datasets show that the proposed CT_CAM module achieves competitive performance compared with nine baseline methods and three other attention modules.",

        "abstract": "These findings advance this improved CRISPRi technology for use in neuronal systems for the first time, potentially enabling improved ability to manipulate gene expression states in the nervous system. The expression of genetic material governs brain development, differentiation, and function, and targeted manipulation of gene expression is required to understand contributions of gene function to health and disease states. Although recent improvements in CRISPR/dCas9 interference (CRISPRi) technology have enabled targeted transcriptional repression at selected genomic sites, integrating these techniques for use in non-dividing neuronal systems remains challenging. Previously, we optimized a dual lentivirus expression system to express CRISPR-based activation machinery in post-mitotic neurons. Here we used a similar strategy to adapt an improved dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 repression system for robust transcriptional inhibition in neurons. We find that lentiviral delivery of a dCas9-KRAB-MeCP2 construct driven by the neuron-selective promoter human synapsin 1 enabled transgene expression in primary rat neurons. Next, we demonstrate transcriptional repression using CRISPR sgRNAs targeting diverse gene promoters, and show superiority of this system in neurons compared to existing RNA interference methods for robust transcript specific manipulation at the complex Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene. Our findings advance this improved CRISPRi technology for use in neuronal systems for the first time, potentially enabling improved ability to manipulate gene expression states in the nervous system.",

        "abstract": "It is revealed that users rely on AI predictions even in the absence of sufficient information needed to assess its correctness, highlighting the gap between how NLP developers perceive informational need in human-AI interaction and the actual human interaction with the information available to them. AI systems have shown impressive performance at answering questions by retrieving relevant context. However, with the increasingly large models, it is impossible and often undesirable to constrain models' knowledge or reasoning to only the retrieved context. This leads to a mismatch between the information that these models access to derive the answer and the information available to the user consuming the AI predictions to assess the AI predicted answer. In this work, we study how users interact with AI systems in absence of sufficient information to assess AI predictions. Further, we ask the question of whether adding the requisite background alleviates the concerns around over-reliance in AI predictions. Our study reveals that users rely on AI predictions even in the absence of sufficient information needed to assess its correctness. Providing the relevant background, however, helps users catch AI errors better, reducing over-reliance on incorrect AI predictions. On the flip side, background information also increases users' confidence in their correct as well as incorrect judgments. Contrary to common expectation, aiding a user's perusal of the context and the background through highlights is not helpful in alleviating the issue of over-confidence stemming from availability of more information. Our work aims to highlight the gap between how NLP developers perceive informational need in human-AI interaction and the actual human interaction with the information available to them.",

        "abstract": "Prospective memory research could profit from more active exploration of the relevance of theoretical constructs from the retrospective memory literature, including a particular area of prefrontal cortex (BA 10) that appears to play an important role in both retrospective and prospective retrieval modes. Klein made the provocative suggestion that the purpose of human episodic memory is to enable individuals to plan and prepare for the future. In other words, although episodic (retrospective) memory is about the past, it is not actually for the past; it is for the future. Within this focus, a natural subject for investigation is prospective memory, or memory to do things in the future. An important theoretical construct in the fields of both retrospective memory and prospective memory is that of a retrieval mode, or a neurocognitive set or readiness to treat environmental stimuli as potential retrieval cues. This construct was originally introduced in a theory of episodic (retrospective) memory and has more recently been invoked in a theory of how some prospective memory tasks are accomplished. To our knowledge, this construct has not been explicitly compared between the two literatures, and thus this is the purpose of the present article. Although we address the behavioral evidence for each construct, our primary goal is to assess the extent to which each retrieval mode appears to rely on a common neural region. Our review highlights the fact that a particular area of prefrontal cortex (BA 10) appears to play an important role in both retrospective and prospective retrieval modes. We suggest, based on this evidence and these ideas, that prospective memory research could profit from more active exploration of the relevance of theoretical constructs from the retrospective memory literature.",

        "abstract": "A comparative analysis performed with other works of the literature can prove the efficiency and reliability of the model based on deep feature extraction for the classification using magnetic resonance imaging for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that results in loss of cognitive ability of the patient. Computational intelligence, more specifically Deep Learning, has been a powerful method for AD diagnosis. In this work we propose a model for AD diagnosis based on deep feature extraction for the classification using magnetic resonance imaging. This model aims to classify AD vs. HC (Healthy Controls). The database used in this project is the Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (MIRIAD), for validation of the proposed method. We select thirty slices from the upper region of the brain, above the eyes, for the apprenticeship in this work. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is designed in three convolutional layers to extract the best features of the selected region. After that, we put the selected attributes in a vector for learning and detection of patterns by another technique of computational intelligence. Finally, the data are partitioned with the 10-folds cross-validation method and trained with the Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithms with different parameters for evaluation. The results of accuracy are 0.8832, 0.9607 and 0.8745, for the algorithms mentioned above, respectively. According to a comparative analysis performed with other works of the literature, we can prove the efficiency and reliability of the model for the diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

        "abstract": "Lower magnetization transfer ratios in the entire cortex and AD-signature regions contribute to cognitive impairment independent of brain atrophy and WM damage, associated with poorer global cognition, language function, and constructional praxis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reductions in magnetization transfer ratio have been associated with brain microstructural damage. We aim to compare magnetization transfer ratio in global and regional GM and WM between individuals with Alzheimer disease and healthy control participants to analyze the relationship between magnetization transfer ratio and cognitive functioning in Alzheimer disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, participants with Alzheimer disease and a group of age-matched healthy control participants underwent clinical examinations and 3T MR imaging. Magnetization transfer ratios were determined in the cortex, AD-signature regions, normal-appearing WM, and WM hyperintensities. RESULTS: Seventy-seven study participants (mean age \u00b1 SD, 72 \u00b1 8\u2009years; 47 female) and 77 age-matched healthy control participants (mean age \u00b1 SD, 72 \u00b1 8 years; 44 female) were evaluated. Magnetization transfer ratio values were lower in patients with Alzheimer disease than in healthy control participants in all investigated regions. When adjusting for atrophy and extent of WM hyperintensities, significant differences were seen in the global cortex (OR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.97; P = .04), in Alzheimer disease\u2013signature regions (OR = 0.31; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.67; P = .003), in normal-appearing WM (OR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.88; P = .01), and in WM hyperintensities (OR = 0.18; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.33; P\u2009\u2264\u2009.001). The magnetization transfer ratio in these regions was an independent determinant of AD. When correcting for atrophy and WM hyperintensity extent, lower GM magnetization transfer ratios were associated with poorer global cognition, language function, and constructional praxis. CONCLUSIONS: Alzheimer disease is associated with magnetization transfer ratio reductions in GM and WM regions of the brain. Lower magnetization transfer ratios in the entire cortex and AD-signature regions contribute to cognitive impairment independent of brain atrophy and WM damage.",

        "abstract": "A novel DL model to be used for addressing classification tasks of medical imaging, called MedNet, which performs as the pre-trained model to tackle any real-world application from medical imaging and achieve the level of generalization needed for dealing with medical imaging tasks, e.g. classification. In the last few years, deep learning (DL) methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in visual object recognition, speech recognition, and object detection, among many other applications. Specifically, DL requires a large amount of training data to provide quality outcomes. However, the field of medical imaging suffers from the lack of sufficient data for properly training DL models because medical images require manual labelling carried out by clinical experts thus the process is time-consuming, expensive, and error prone. Recently, transfer learning (TL) was introduced to reduce the need for the annotation procedure by means of transferring the knowledge performed by a previous task and then fine-tuning the result using a relatively small dataset. Nowadays, multiple classification methods from medical imaging make use of TL from general-purpose pre-trained models, e.g., ImageNet, which has been proven to be ineffective due to the mismatch between the features learned from natural images (ImageNet) and those more specific from medical images especially medical gray images such as X-rays. ImageNet does not have grayscale images such as MRI, CT, and X-ray. In this paper, we propose a novel DL model to be used for addressing classification tasks of medical imaging, called MedNet. To do so, we aim to issue two versions of MedNet. The first one is Gray-MedNet which will be trained on 3M publicly available gray-scale medical images including MRI, CT, X-ray, ultrasound, and PET. The second version is Color-MedNet which will be trained on 3M publicly available color medical images including histopathology, taken images, and many other. To validate the effectiveness MedNet, both versions will be fine-tuned to train on the target tasks of a more reduced set of medical images. MedNet performs as the pre-trained model to tackle any real-world application from medical imaging and achieve the level of generalization needed for dealing with medical imaging tasks, e.g. classification. MedNet would serve the research community as a baseline for future research.",

This article presents a pilot study testing the feasibility and effect of a conversational robot in a cognitive assessment task with older adults with AD. We examine the robot interactions through dialogue and miscommunication analysis, linguistic feature analysis, and the use of a qualitative analysis, in which we report key themes that were prevalent throughout the study. While conversations were typically better with human conversation partners (being longer, with greater engagement and less misunderstanding), we found that the robot was generally well liked by participants and that it was able to capture their interest in dialogue. Miscommunication due to issues of understanding and intelligibility did not seem to deter participants from their experience. Furthermore, in automatically extracting linguistic features, we examine how non-acoustic aspects of language change across participants with varying degrees of cognitive impairment, highlighting the robot\u2019s potential as a monitoring tool. This pilot study is an exploration of how conversational robots can be used to support individuals with AD.",

Brain network alterations have increasingly been implicated in schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). However, little is known about the similarities and differences in functional brain networks among patients with SCZ, BD, and MDD. A total of 512 participants (121 with SCZ, 100 with BD, 108 with MDD, and 183 healthy controls, matched for age and sex) completed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging at a single site. Four global measures (the clustering coefficient, the characteristic shortest path length, the normalized clustering coefficient, and the normalized characteristic path length) were computed at a voxel level to quantify segregated and integrated configurations. Inter-regional functional associations were examined based on the Euclidean distance between regions. Distance strength maps were used to localize regions with altered distances based on functional connectivity. Patient groups exhibited shifts in their network architectures toward randomized configurations, with SCZ>BD>MDD in the degree of randomization. Patient groups displayed significantly decreased short-range connectivity and increased medium-/long-range connectivity. Decreases in short-range connectivity were similar across the SZ, BD, and MDD groups and were primarily distributed in the primary sensory and association cortices and the thalamus. Increases in medium-/long-range connectivity were differentially localized within the prefrontal cortices among the patient groups. We highlight shared and distinct connectivity features in functional brain networks among patients with SCZ, BD, and MDD, which expands our understanding of the common and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms and provides crucial insights into neuroimaging-based methods for the early diagnosis of and interventions for psychiatric disorders.",

        "abstract": "This approach indicates specific disruptions of EC in the DMN of patients with AD and might be suitable to test molecular theories about downstream and upstream spreading of neuropathology in AD. A prominent finding of postmortem and molecular imaging studies on Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of neuropathological proteins in brain regions of the default mode network (DMN). Molecular models suggest that the progression of disease proteins depends on the directionality of signaling pathways. At network level, effective connectivity (EC) reflects directionality of signaling pathways. We hypothesized a specific pattern of EC in the DMN of patients with AD, related to cognitive impairment. Metabolic connectivity mapping is a novel measure of EC identifying regions of signaling input based on neuroenergetics. We simultaneously acquired resting\u2010state functional MRI and FDG\u2010PET data from patients with early AD (n\u2009=\u200935) and healthy subjects (n\u2009=\u200918) on an integrated PET/MR scanner. We identified two distinct subnetworks of EC in the DMN of healthy subjects: an anterior part with bidirectional EC between hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex and a posterior part with predominant input into medial parietal cortex. Patients had reduced input into the medial parietal system and absent input from hippocampus into medial prefrontal cortex (p\u2009<\u20090.05, corrected). In a multiple linear regression with unimodal imaging and EC measures (F4,25\u2009=\u20095.63, p\u2009=\u20090.002, r2\u2009=\u20090.47), we found that EC (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.45, p\u2009=\u20090.012) was stronger associated with cognitive deficits in patients than any of the PET and fMRI measures alone. Our approach indicates specific disruptions of EC in the DMN of patients with AD and might be suitable to test molecular theories about downstream and upstream spreading of neuropathology in AD.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a model-free algorithm based on temporal difference learning and a near-greedy heuristic for action selection that exhibits good convergence properties and discovers meaningful near-equivalent actions in healthcare settings. Standard reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find an optimal policy that identifies the best action for each state. However, in healthcare settings, many actions may be near-equivalent with respect to the reward (e.g., survival). We consider an alternative objective -- learning set-valued policies to capture near-equivalent actions that lead to similar cumulative rewards. We propose a model-free algorithm based on temporal difference learning and a near-greedy heuristic for action selection. We analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed algorithm, providing optimality guarantees and demonstrate our approach on simulated environments and a real clinical task. Empirically, the proposed algorithm exhibits good convergence properties and discovers meaningful near-equivalent actions. Our work provides theoretical, as well as practical, foundations for clinician/human-in-the-loop decision making, in which humans (e.g., clinicians, patients) can incorporate additional knowledge (e.g., side effects, patient preference) when selecting among near-equivalent actions.",

        "abstract": "This work introduces Sparse-IFT, a family of Sparse Iso-FLOP Transformations which are used as drop-in replacements for dense layers to improve their representational capacity and FLOP efficiency and leads to significant improvements across computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recent works have explored the use of weight sparsity to improve the training efficiency (test accuracy w.r.t training FLOPs) of deep neural networks (DNNs). These works aim to reduce training FLOPs but training with sparse weights often leads to accuracy loss or requires longer training schedules, making the resulting training efficiency less clear. In contrast, we focus on using sparsity to increase accuracy while using the same FLOPs as the dense model and show training efficiency gains through higher accuracy. In this work, we introduce Sparse-IFT, a family of Sparse Iso-FLOP Transformations which are used as drop-in replacements for dense layers to improve their representational capacity and FLOP efficiency. Each transformation is parameterized by a single hyperparameter (sparsity level) and provides a larger search space to find optimal sparse masks. Without changing any training hyperparameters, replacing dense layers with Sparse-IFT leads to significant improvements across computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including ResNet-18 on ImageNet (+3.5%) and GPT-3 Small on WikiText-103 (-0.4 PPL), both matching larger dense model variants that use 2x or more FLOPs. To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the use of sparsity for improving the accuracy of dense models via a simple-to-use set of sparse transformations.

        "abstract": "This work proposes Hibert (as shorthand for HIerachical Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for document encoding and a method to pre-train it using unlabeled data and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on these two datasets. Neural extractive summarization models usually employ a hierarchical encoder for document encoding and they are trained using sentence-level labels, which are created heuristically using rule-based methods. Training the hierarchical encoder with these inaccurate labels is challenging. Inspired by the recent work on pre-training transformer sentence encoders (Devlin et al., 2018), we propose Hibert (as shorthand for HIerachical Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for document encoding and a method to pre-train it using unlabeled data. We apply the pre-trained Hibert to our summarization model and it outperforms its randomly initialized counterpart by 1.25 ROUGE on the CNN/Dailymail dataset and by 2.0 ROUGE on a version of New York Times dataset. We also achieve the state-of-the-art performance on these two datasets.",

        "abstract": "A new model called word-concept heterogeneous graph convolution network (WC-HGCN) is proposed to introduce interactive information between words and concepts for short text classification and an innovative learning strategy is designed, which can make full use of the introduced concept information. Text classification is an important task in natural language processing. However, most of the existing models focus on long texts, and their performance in short texts is not satisfied due to the problem of data sparsity. To solve this problem, recent studies have introduced the concepts of words to enrich the representation of short texts. However, these methods ignore the interactive information between words and concepts and lead introduced concepts to be noises unsuitable for semantic understanding. In this paper, we propose a new model called word-concept heterogeneous graph convolution network (WC-HGCN) to introduce interactive information between words and concepts for short text classification. WC-HGCN develops words and relevant concepts and adopts graph convolution networks to learn the representation with interactive information. Furthermore, we design an innovative learning strategy, which can make full use of the introduced concept information. Experimental results on seven real short text datasets show that our model outperforms latest baseline methods.",

        "abstract": "The proposed model is proved to solve the problem of predicting long time series PM2.5 concentrations in the future, which can make up for the shortcomings of the currently existing models and have good application value. Accurate air quality prediction is of great significance for pollution prevention and disaster prevention. Effective and reliable prediction models are needed not only for short time prediction, but are even more important for long time-series future predictions. In the long time series, most of the current models might not function as accurately as in the short period and thus a new model is required. In this paper, the new PM2.5 predictor is proposed to achieve accurate long time series PM2.5 prediction in Beijing. The predictor simplifies the input parameters through Spearman correlation analysis and implements the long time series prediction through Informer. The results show that AQI, CO, NO2, and PM10 concentrations are selected from the air quality data, and Dew Point Temperature (DEWP) and wind speed are incorporated from two meteorological data to better improve the prediction efficiency by almost 27%. By comparing with LSTM and attention-LSTM models, the model constructed in this paper performs well in different prediction time periods, with at least 21%, 19%, 28%, and 35% improvement in accuracy in four prediction time series: 48 h, 7 days, 14 days, and 30 days. In conclusion, the proposed model is proved to solve the problem of predicting long time series PM2.5 concentrations in the future, which can make up for the shortcomings of the currently existing models and have good application value.",

        "abstract": "Experimental results from 26 datasets of the well-known multivariate time series archive UEA show that the performance of the proposed Convolutional Transformer Network is better than that of most state-of-the-art models. Convolutional neural network has achieved remarkable success, and has excellent local feature extraction ability. Similarly, Transformer has been developed markedly in recent years, achieving excellent representation capabilities in terms of global features, which has aroused heated discussions. In terms of multivariate time series classification, most previous networks had convolution and long and short-term memory structures. This paper innovatively proposes a combination of Transformer-encoder and convolutional structures, which we refer to as the Multivariate time series classification Convolutional Transformer Network (MCTNet). The different advantages of convolutional neural network and self-attention are used to capture potential deep information in multivariate time series more accurately. The Transformer is considered to be data-hungry, and combined with the induction bias of the convolutional neural network to solve this problem, early features are extracted through the convolutional layers, and the both squeeze and excitation convolution encoder (BC-Encoder) structure is proposed. Attentional prototype learning is also used to mitigate the limited label problem. Moreover, a new network design that focuses on slices and channels is proposed, moving beyond the concept that the use of Transformer will require many parameters. Experimental results from 26 datasets of the well-known multivariate time series archive UEA show that the performance of our model is better than that of most state-of-the-art models.",

        "abstract": "An intron-containing Cre-dependent CRISPRa system (SVI-DIO-dCas9-VPR) is developed that alleviated leaky gene induction and outperformed the traditional DIO system at endogenous genes in both HEK293T cells and rat primary neuron cultures. Site-specific genetic and epigenetic targeting of distinct cell populations is a central goal in molecular neuroscience and is crucial to understand the gene regulatory mechanisms that underlie complex phenotypes and behaviors. While recent technological advances have enabled unprecedented control over gene expression, many of these approaches are focused on selected model organisms and/or require labor-intensive customizations for different applications. The simplicity and modularity of CRISPR-based systems have transformed this aspect of genome editing, providing a variety of possible applications and targets. However, there are currently few available tools for cell-selective CRISPR regulation in neurons. Here, we optimized a CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) system for Cre recombinase-dependent, cell type-specific targeting. Unexpectedly, CRISPR systems based on a traditional double-floxed inverted open reading frame (DIO) strategy exhibited leaky target gene induction in the absence of Cre. Therefore, we developed an intron-containing Cre-dependent CRISPRa system (SVI-DIO-dCas9-VPR) that alleviated leaky gene induction and outperformed the traditional DIO system at endogenous genes in both HEK293T cells and rat primary neuron cultures. Using gene-specific CRISPR sgRNAs, we demonstrate that SVI-DIO-dCas9-VPR can activate highly inducible genes (GRM2 and Tent5b) as well as moderately inducible genes (Sstr2 and Gadd45b) in a Cre-specific manner. These results provide a robust framework for Cre-dependent CRISPR-dCas9 approaches across different model systems, and will enable cell-specific targeting when combined with common Cre driver lines or Cre delivery via viral vectors.",

The question addressed in this paper is: If we present to a user an AI system that explains how it works, how do we know whether the explanation works and the user has achieved a pragmatic understanding of the AI? In other words, how do we know that an explanainable AI system (XAI) is any good? Our focus is on the key concepts of measurement. We discuss specific methods for evaluating: (1) the goodness of explanations, (2) whether users are satisfied by explanations, (3) how well users understand the AI systems, (4) how curiosity motivates the search for explanations, (5) whether the user's trust and reliance on the AI are appropriate, and finally, (6) how the human-XAI work system performs. The recommendations we present derive from our integration of extensive research literatures and our own psychometric evaluations.",

        "abstract": "It is shown that intention deactivation and the occurrence of aftereffects are modulated by a multitude of factors that either foster a rapid deactivation or lead to continued retrieval of completed intentions. Prospective memory, the ability to perform an intended action in the future, is an essential aspect of goal-directed behavior. Intentions influence our behavior and shape the way we process and interact with our environment. One important question for research on prospective memory and goal-directed behavior is whether this influence stops after the intention has been completed successfully. Are intention representations deactivated from memory after their completion, and if so, how? Here, we systematically review 20 years of research on intention deactivation and so-called aftereffects of completed intentions across different research fields to offer an integrative perspective on this topic. We first introduce the currently dominant accounts of aftereffects (inhibition vs. retrieval) and illustrate the paradigms, findings, and interpretations that these accounts developed from. We then review the evidence for each account based on the extant research in these paradigms. While early studies proposed a rapid deactivation or even inhibition of completed intentions, more recent studies mostly suggested that intentions continue to be retrieved even after completion and interfere with subsequent performance. Although these accounts of aftereffects seem mutually exclusive, we will show that they might be two sides of the same coin. That is, intention deactivation and the occurrence of aftereffects are modulated by a multitude of factors that either foster a rapid deactivation or lead to continued retrieval of completed intentions. Lastly, we outline future directions and novel experimental procedures for research on mechanisms and modulators of intention deactivation and discuss practical implications of our findings.

        "abstract": "A deep learning based Convolutional Neural Network model is proposed, which uses the patient\u2019s chest X-ray images for the diagnosis of COVID-19 with an aim to help the physicians to assist the diagnostic process among high workload conditions. The novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease that is currently affecting over 200 countries around the world and more than 6 millions of people died in last 2\u00a0years. Early detection of COVID-19 can mitigate and control its spread. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-CPR), Chest X-ray (CXR) scan, and Computerized Tomography (CT) scan are used to identify the COVID-19. Chest X-ray image analysis is relatively time efficient than compared with RT-CPR and CT scan. Its cost-effectiveness make it a good choice for COVID-19 Classification. We propose a deep learning based Convolutional Neural Network model for detection of COVID-19 from CXR. Chest X-ray images are collected from various sources dataset for training with augmentation and evaluating our model, which is widely used for COVID-19 detection and diagnosis. A Deep Convolutional neural network (CNN) based model for analysis of COVID-19 with data augmentation is proposed, which uses the patient\u2019s chest X-ray images for the diagnosis of COVID-19 with an aim to help the physicians to assist the diagnostic process among high workload conditions. The overall accuracy of 93 percent for COVID-19 Classification is achieved by choosing best optimizer.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the current cutting edge applications of CNN on single and multimodality (combination of two or more modalities) neuroimaging data for the classification of AD and examines the effectiveness of classification approaches on AD to analyze different kinds of datasets, neuroim imaging modalities, preprocessing techniques, and data handling methods. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most generally known neurodegenerative disorder, leading to a steady deterioration in cognitive ability. Deep learning models have shown outstanding performance in the diagnosis of AD, and these models do not need any handcrafted feature extraction over conventional machine learning algorithms. Since the 2012 AlexNet accomplishment, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has been progressively utilized by the medical community to assist practitioners to early diagnose AD. This paper explores the current cutting edge applications of CNN on single and multimodality (combination of two or more modalities) neuroimaging data for the classification of AD. An exhaustive systematic search is conducted on four notable databases: Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and PubMed in June 2021. The objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of classification approaches on AD to analyze different kinds of datasets, neuroimaging modalities, preprocessing techniques, and data handling methods. However, CNN has achieved great success in the classification of AD; still, there are a lot of challenges particularly due to scarcity of medical imaging data and its possible scope in this field.",

BACKGROUND\nBiomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are crucial for early diagnosis and treatment monitoring once disease modifying therapies become available.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThis study aims to quantify the forward magnetization transfer rate (kfor) map from brain tissue water to macromolecular protons and use it to identify the brain regions with abnormal kfor in AD and AD progression.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFrom the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) cognition study, magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) was acquired at baseline from 63 participants, including 20 normal controls (NC), 18 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 25 AD subjects. Of those, 53 participants completed a follow-up MRI scan and were divided into four groups: 15 stable NC, 12 NC-to-MCI, 12 stable MCI, and 14 MCI/AD-to-AD subjects. kfor maps were compared across NC, MCI, and AD groups at baseline for the cross-sectional study and across four longitudinal groups for the longitudinal study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe found a lower kfor in the frontal gray matter (GM), parietal GM, frontal corona radiata (CR) white matter (WM) tracts, frontal and parietal superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) WM tracts in AD relative to both NC and MCI. Further, we observed progressive decreases of kfor in the frontal GM, parietal GM, frontal and parietal CR WM tracts, and parietal SLF WM tracts in stable MCI. In the parietal GM, parietal CR WM tracts, and parietal SLF WM tracts, we found trend differences between MCI/AD-to-AD and stable NC.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nForward magnetization transfer rate is a promising biomarker for AD diagnosis and progression.",

        "abstract": "The 2D-Slice-CNN architecture of Gupta et al. (2021) is leveraged, which embeds all the MRI slices with 2D encoders (neural networks that take 2D image input) and combines them via permutation-invariant layers and improves the modeling capabilities of 2D -Slice models by incorporating spatial information through position embeddings, which can improve the performance in some cases. Transfer learning has remarkably improved computer vision. These advances also promise improvements in neuroimaging, where training set sizes are often small. However, various difficulties arise in directly applying models pretrained on natural images to radiologic images, such as MRIs. In particular, a mismatch in the input space (2D images vs. 3D MRIs) restricts the direct transfer of models, often forcing us to consider only a few MRI slices as input. To this end, we leverage the 2D-Slice-CNN architecture of Gupta et al. (2021), which embeds all the MRI slices with 2D encoders (neural networks that take 2D image input) and combines them via permutation-invariant layers. With the insight that the pretrained model can serve as the 2D encoder, we initialize the 2D encoder with ImageNet pretrained weights that outperform those initialized and trained from scratch on two neuroimaging tasks -- brain age prediction on the UK Biobank dataset and Alzheimer's disease detection on the ADNI dataset. Further, we improve the modeling capabilities of 2D-Slice models by incorporating spatial information through position embeddings, which can improve the performance in some cases.",

        "abstract": "Common hyper-integrated modular architectures of functional brain networks among patients with SCZ, BD, and MDD are demonstrated, revealing a transdiagnostic mechanism of network dysfunction across psychiatric disorders from a connectomic perspective. Psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), share clinical and neurobiological features. Because previous investigations of functional dysconnectivity have mainly focused on single disorders, the transdiagnostic alterations in the functional connectome architecture of the brain remain poorly understood. We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 512 participants, including 121 with SCZ, 100 with BD, 108 with MDD, and 183 healthy controls. Individual functional brain connectomes were constructed in a voxelwise manner, and the modular architectures were examined at different scales, including (1) global modularity, (2) module-specific segregation and intra- and intermodular connections, and (3) nodal participation coefficients. The correlation of these modular measures with clinical scores was also examined. We reliably identify common alterations in modular organization in patients compared to controls, including (1) lower global modularity; (2) lower modular segregation in the frontoparietal, subcortical, visual, and sensorimotor modules driven by more intermodular connections; and (3) higher participation coefficients in several network connectors (the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus) and the thalamus. Furthermore, the alterations in the SCZ group are more widespread than those of the BD and MDD groups and involve more intermodular connections, lower modular segregation and higher connector integrity. These alterations in modular organization significantly correlate with clinical scores in patients. This study demonstrates common hyper-integrated modular architectures of functional brain networks among patients with SCZ, BD, and MDD. These findings reveal a transdiagnostic mechanism of network dysfunction across psychiatric disorders from a connectomic perspective.",
